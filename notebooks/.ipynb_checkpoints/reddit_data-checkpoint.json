    "selftext": "I don't get why this won best picture. If I were to elevator pitch this movie honestly I would say its a lot of nice tits and ass, some slapstick, and a faygo-type off-brand version of an A24 film (either Good Time or Uncut Gems) however unlike those films, there's just plotholes in this one that make it unbearable.\n\nThe entire movie is falsified by Anora going to multiple highly populated places and just going along with the captors. In the house she was screaming bloody murder to the point they gagged her with a scarf.\n\nThey freaked out about her raising hell, attacking and screaming. But lets just take her with us trying to find the guy. Why wouldn't they hold her until they found her husband? But much more importantly, why the fuck isn't she screaming in public that shes being kidnapped? We know that 10k ain't shit to her.\n\nWhy does she bring them to her friends candy shop? Why don't they call the cops when they bash up the candy shop? Why don't they call the cops for the entire time they muscle into the strip club?\n\nThis movie is devoid of critical thinking. If that's a statement on sex workers and nepo babies then ok. Finally, I'm weirded out that this movie kinda made Russia sexy. Her going after the guy that kidnapped her and normalizing that he could go from hostage taker to \"it was just a meet cute\", idk. It's got something I can't put my finger on but if Russia rigged the Oscars we're in trouble. I got this movie at a 4/10. Brutalist takes this year IMO.\n\nedit: \nbonus positives: it's well shot, well edited, the actors were fine, the coloring and pacing was cool. However, I wasn't a fan of the soundtrack and the people yelling over each other was very annoying.",

Especially if you are watching the movies in order like I am. It's nice to just tone it down and go on a mission with Spiderman. Also he is my favourite Marvel superhero so I will forever glaze.\n\nNed is also a great addition and they add MJ in so subtly for the next few movies just kinda building up her character and having Liz as the main love interest instead. The plot twist of her dad being the vulture is good to although it's definitely not that much of a surprise and pretty predictable. But non the less still good.",

    "title": "\"Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning\" review",
    "selftext": "Director Christopher McQuarrie has quite the track record with Tom Cruise. Cruise has starred in his last five movies and just one without him in total. A 2000 movie named “The Way of the Gun”. The crazy part is that the last four movies are all Mission: Impossible movies, and four of the best to top it off. So, right out of the gate, this had success written all over it.\n\n“Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning” is a cinematic wonder to behold, and I highly recommend you try to see it on the big screen. These films have always done the biggest and craziest stunts and most beautiful shots that you can imagine, so as the supposed last film in the franchise… at least with this lineup, no punches were pulled.\n\nHonestly, if you are looking for a great time for about three hours with lots of action, over-the-top stunts, some comedy, and a little sadness, then this will be perfect for you. If “The Final Reckoning” is your first Mission: Impossible movie, first of all, welcome. Secondly, other than character back stories, you should be able to watch this without having watched the first seven. Personally, I went back and re-watched them all to re-acquaint myself, and it does make this one mean more if you do, but it will still be enjoyable either way.\n\nMy final thoughts on “The Final Reckoning” are this. Don’t listen to any bad reviews or criticisms that say this story isn’t very exciting. They clearly weren’t watching the same movie as I just did if that’s the case.\n\nI can easily give this a 9 out of 10!\n\nSee my full review here:\n\n[https://1guysmindlessmoviereviews.com/2025/05/29/mission-impossible-the-final-reckoning/](https://1guysmindlessmoviereviews.com/2025/05/29/mission-impossible-the-final-reckoning/)",

    "title": "\"The Legend of Ochi\" Review: Visually Stunning but Emotionally Empty",
    "selftext": "*The Legend of Ochi* is the newest A24 movie, coming out a couple of weeks ago. This family fantasy movie was written and directed by Isaiah Saxon. This was actually Saxon's first time directing a movie. The movie stars Helena Zengel, Willem Dafoe, Finn Wolfhard, and Emily Watson. The movie is about a girl, Yuri (Zengel), who lives in a village where they fear the ochi, an elusive animal species. However, she discovers a baby ochi, and she makes it her mission to bring it back home.\n\nVisually, this movie is very stunning. The fantasy world takes place in the mountains, and the designers painted matte paintings used for the backgrounds. These paintings created beautiful backgrounds, but the natural setting looks great too. Puppetry and practical effects used for the ochi enhanced the visuals by creating a more realistic feel. It reminded me of the movie *Gremlins*. Movies should try to use practical effects when it is possible. They just create something different.\n\n  \nWillem Dafoe tries to spice things up with his typical performance. The quirky movie definitely fit his style, so he naturally thrived in this movie. He was really the only character I liked in the movie. He always has a certain vibe with his characters, and I think he always steals the scene when he's present. This certainly did feel like an A24 movie due to the style of the movie. I never thought there would be an A24 arthouse family movie.\n\nThe plot is very straightforward in the movie, but this is not the problem. The problem is that it feels very empty. There are barely any side stories, and there isn't much to the main plot either. The main plot is just about Yuri bringing the ochi back to its family. The side stuff revolves around the broken family dynamic. The mother, played by Emily Watson, is thrown in there, but she only gives a little exposition dump to Yuri about Ochi. The moments that were supposed to be emotional or about family just didn't land for me.\n\n  \nThe characters don't add much for me either. Willem Dafoe and the cute baby ochi are the only things that intrigue me. I don't think Zengel did badly, but there wasn't much going on with her. The lack of dialogue and depth to characters created characters I didn't care for. I am also not the target audience for this movie. This certainly was more for kids. The humor was fine, but it wasn't my type of humor.\n\n*The Legend of Ochi* was a movie that I thought would be enjoyable, but it ended up being a disappointment. The movie looked great and had Dafoe, but this couldn't save the movie for me. I just don't think this is my type of movie. I would recommend this movie to families, but that is about it.\n\n  \nFor star rating and other reviews, check out my blog\n\n[https://rtreviews4.wordpress.com/2025/05/30/the-legend-of-ochi-review-visually-stunning-but-emotionally-empty/](https://rtreviews4.wordpress.com/2025/05/30/the-legend-of-ochi-review-visually-stunning-but-emotionally-empty/)",

    "title": "Karate Kid: Legends - The Age of Legacy",
    "selftext": "In my opinion, it all started with [**Spider-Man: No Way Home**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/spiderman-no-way-home-everything-you-expected-and-more), which brought together varied generations of actors playing the same role simultaneously. Then came[ **Deadpool & Wolverine**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/deadpool-wolverine-a-fun-ride), where Deadpool gathers \"the others\" with Wesley Snipes as Blade, saying \"Legacy.\" Now, we have Karate Kid: Legends - \"Two branches, one tree.\"\n\nTMJ Rating: 🍿🍿🍿🍿/ 5\n\nKarate Kid: Legends is a fast-paced action movie that continues the legacy of Sensei Miyagi with loads of history, a good screenplay, a great cast, crisp editing, and amazing execution. Watch It!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yxdoln9bez3f1.png?width=707&format=png&auto=webp&s=f06feb4892c3393531e806f2cc93c47daccde446\n\n\n\n# The Plot of Karate Kid: Legends\n\nMr. Han from the terrible remake with Jaden Smith has now opened a grand dojo of his own in Beijing, China. He is coaching a student named Li Fong played by Ben Wang who with his mother is recovering from [**losing a loved one**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/movies-and-series-about-losing-a-loved-one)**,** Li's brother and Dr. Fong's son.\n\nWhen Dr. Fong, played by Ming-Na Wen, gets a better job opportunity in New York City, she ensures she takes her son with her, mirroring how Daniel ( Ralph Macchio ) moves into Reseda with his mom in search of a new and better life.\n\nBut Li Fong is struggling with the trauma of losing his brother in a violent altercation, unlike Daniel, and has to fit in with a whole new crowd as well. He makes fast friends on the very first day in the Big Apple with the charming Sadie Stanley as Mia Lipani, which also leads to friction with one of her exes, played by Aramis Knight as Conor.\n\nHence begins the showdown between good and evil, between wrong and right, with a lot of fast-paced action, great background score, good humor, and blink and you'll miss it callbacks.\n\n***Check out*** [***Your Friends and Neighbors Apple TV+ Series Review***](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/your-friends-and-neighbors-series-apple-tv)\n\nI don't know about the US release, but in Bengaluru, India, there is this rough movie editing at least once that I noticed in which the transition felt abrupt. But otherwise, the movie is really crisp and clean, no sloppy sections, no lingering, just lightning-quick scene transitions in both the first and the second acts.\n\nThere's even a scene where Ralph Macchio and Jackie Chan team up on a couple of people in a massive crowd and diffuse the situation faster than it started - simply brilliant. I wonder how much Jaden Smith's terrible remake had to do with making this movie as clean and fast as possible.\n\n# The Age of Legacy Movie-Making\n\nMarvel began with phase one, where it created detailed origin stories and fleshed out characters in high detail, beginning with Iron Man and ending phase one with [**The Avengers**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/2018/11/05/marvels-the-avengers-fight-styles) in 2012.\n\nThe age of legacy actors has officially begun! And I'm loving it! Bringing disparate yet related storylines into a single narrative is what will continue to drive the story since Marvel started creating its universe.\n\nThe next level of storytelling is to dig up either successful or obscure franchises, be it series or movies, breathe new life into them by supporting them with current storylines, and pray to the gods of cinema that it will work. You might argue - those are just reboots and remakes, aren't they? Not even close.\n\n***Check out*** [***Netflix Mini Series Review: The Residence***](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/netflix-mini-series-the-residence-review)\n\nA remake or reboot is what happens when you dust off old movie scripts, ignore any plot points, and start afresh, such as the trials and tribulations of the Hulk movie franchise, the Superman movie franchise, and most definitely The Batman movie franchise. But now, however, after Christopher Nolan's golden touch with his Dark Knight trilogy, even Matt Reeves' take on The Batman is doing well.\n\nThe Flash movie was a wonderful way to weave in legacy actors organically while retaining the plotlines of every generation intact, making it an awesome watch. You get to see and hear \"You wanna get nuts? Let's get nuts!\" and also the iconic \"Yeah, I'm Batman\"\n\n# The Cast\n\nBen Wang as Li Fong plays a great Karate Kid for both Shifu Han and Sensei LaRusso to train in a record-breaking time of one week to fine-tune Fong's Kung-fu and teaching very particular portions of Karate needed to win a massive Karate championship.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised to see Joshua Jackson as Victor Lipani, who, along with every fan of [**90s shows**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/80s-and-90s-tv-shows-usa) and movies. My clearest memory of him was from The Mighty Ducks movies and Urban Legend, although many of you will know him from Dawson's Creek or other shows or movies.\n\nSadie Stanley as Mia Lipani is a breath of fresh air as the quintessential New Yorker supporting her single dad in his pizza place and trying to live life as best as she can. Her expressive face and body language make it a pleasure to watch her perform on-screen in this movie, reminding me so much of Melissa O'Neil from the hit series The Rookie.\n\nMing-Na Wen as Dr. Fong is one of the most versatile actors I've seen on screen, playing Charlie Harper's girlfriend in the sitcom [**Two and a Half Men**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/why-two-and-a-half-men-is-a-tragic-series-with-a-laugh-track), a bada$$ agent in the series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and who can forget her role as Chun-Li in the movie adaptation of the game Street Fighter.\n\n***You might like*** [***Novocaine (2025) Movie Review***](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/novocaine-2025-movie-review)\n\nWyatt Oleff as Alan, you might have seen him playing the squirrelly kid in the horror movie IT, and the Netflix series I Am Not Okay With This, all three roles with the character exhibiting a similar temperament.\n\nI remember Aramis Knight most recently while watching the awesomely funny [**Psych series**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/psych-series-review), and a few years ago when I saw Ender's Game. Here, he plays a random bully without much screentime for any depth or proper backstory.\n\n  \nRalph Macchio as Daniel LaRusso is basically himself in the movie, as the original Karate Kid, and shares an easy chemistry with Jackie Chan, who together make great jokes. As for Jackie Chan, it's Jackie Chan! He can just say his name for two hours consecutively, and I would still watch that movie.\n\n***Read*** [***Snakes and Ladders Spanish Netflix Series***](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/snakes-and-ladders-spanish-netflix-series-surprisingly-sharp)\n\nFor fans of Schitt's Creek, you might recognize Tim Rozon, who played Mutt Schitt, the son of the Mayor in the show Roland Schitt. Here, Rozon plays O' Shea, a loan shark who keeps unsavory company to collect on his debts.\n\n\n\n# Should You Watch It? Yes!\n\nKarate Kid: Legends is a fitting homage to Pat Morita and the Karate Kid franchise in general. The movie is fast, with a simple yet well-executed plotline with legacy actors and a few new ones that outperform everyone on-screen - watch it!\n\n***Like this review?*** [**Subscribe**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/contact) ***to*** [**themoviejunkie.com**](http://themoviejunkie.com/)***!***",

      "Perhaps your \"filler\" feelings is due to your current experiences with film trilogies and 4+ movie franchises. Back un the original trilogy era, sequels were rare. Trilogies were practically non-existent. Sequels were just the next movie. There weren't grand revelations. There wasn't decontextualizing of previous events. There weren't seeds planted in one movie to be sowed two or three films down the line. Instead, the original trilogy was laying the foundations of the rules that Hollywood would incorporate for decades to come. What you call \"Like all middle trilogy movies are,\" was actually the trailblazing cinema for its time.\n\nYou also have the benefit of knowing how the original trilogy unfolds, so everything seems to get wrapped up in a nice little package.\n\nHOWEVER...\n\nThink back to the production of those movies. In A New Hope, Darth Vader was written as a high level thug, like Oddjob and Jaws from the James Bond movies. Vader wasn't written to be Luke's father, and Leia certainly wasn't written to be Luke's twin sister. Therefore in Empire Strikes Back when Vader said, \"No. I am your father.\" even James Earl Jones thought the character was lying. Those five simple words were as much a retcon as they were a revelation. Obi-Wan in Return Of The Jedi saying, \"What I told you was true from a certain point of view.\" might be the best plot hole fixes in history. \n\nLet's take a moment to consider Yoda. Do you think audiences would have ever imagined a Jedi master being an old pint-sized backwards talking alien? \n\nThere was also the first on screen sighting of The Emperor. If Darth Vader must kneel in the Emperor's presence and Vader would need Luke's help to overthrow the dark master, then audiences would have been brimming with anticipation to see how dangerous the character must be. \n\nWe also have the growing love triangle between Han, Luke, and Leia. (Again, she was not written to be Luke's secret twin in Episodes 4 and 5.) Romance has been a feature of storytelling ever since humanity developed the concept of fiction. Then came \"I love you!\" - \"I know.\" Another example of five small words changing the game forever. \n\nLet's finish by talking about the movie's finish. Think about every adventure story you've watched or read that was created before Empire Strikes Back, How many of them end on a bittersweet tone? How many of them end with the heroes firmly on the backfoot? How many of them end with no clear path for the audience to guess what will happen next? Cliffhangers had been established with serialized short films, but Empire Strikes Back left audiences completely bewildered. \n\nThey didn't know if Vader was lying or not. They couldn't foresee alien teddy bears helping overthrow the Empire. They couldn't imagine the great hero of the saga becoming the villain. (George Lucas had one draft in which Luke took the mantle of Darth Vader.) \"No, there is another\" was supposed to be the setup for a brand new character, not a refence to Leia. (Seriously, Leia originally did not have family ties to the other characters.) Do you think ANYONE would have had Darth Vader Face Turn on their predictions bingo card for the conclusion film? Heck, will the next movie even be a conclusion? Who knows how many more stories their might be. \n\nSHORT-SHORT VERSION = Perhaps you should recalibrate your perception about The Empire Strikes Back. Nowadays, movie studios are trying to launch film franchises before they have the first draft of a first movie. During the time of the Original Trilogy, George Lucas was building, destroying, and rebuilding the rules of fiction with each production. It is fine that you like the other movies more. But dismissing the events of The Empire Strikes Back as \"filler\" is - to borrow a phrase from another space fiction franchise - highly illogical.",
      "I watched the trilogy again (after some years) this week directly after Andor and R1 and Empire is leagues better than ANH. It's almost like a different genre. That's not to say ANH isn't entertaining for what it is but it's not great.",
      "Yea don't get me wrong I love this movie as I mentioned I have a poster of it. But IV is just incredible and I love Anakin's redemption in VI. I feel like this for most trilogy's I felt like this for II as well.",
      "I like the movie its really good like I said their is a poster of it in my room. I just think its not the best one in my opinion. I know I am alone on that opinion, but I love the fist movie and the last one a little more than this movie.",
      "I can see where your coming from with all of your points I maybe should have rephrased what I was saying. By \"filler\" I meant that the 2nd movie just kinda moves the story along to set up for the last movie because I have previously watched these before so I knew what happens. All of your points are kinda thinking about things first time watchers would have thought which is what I did think watching this movie for the first time when I was like 7. But knowing what happens, it kinda dampened the experience a little upon rewatch, because I knew what was going to happen. I understand that this film was incredible for the time it was made and I love star wars as a franchise but in my opinion this is the weakest of the 3 movies. The first one for me was absolutely incredible and its difficult to top and that is what that movie is trying to follow. The last one with Vader's redemption as well is so good. IV for me is 5 stars and V IV are both 4.5 for me, not perfect but still incredible. I know I am alone on this opinion but that is my opinion at the end of the day.",

    "title": "Movie Review - Karate Kid: Legends",
    "selftext": "https://youtu.be/TSCFxLUTTcA?feature=shared\n\nKarate Kid: Legends - 7/10. Fun, but flawed. No one was really asking for a new instalment for this franchise, but “Karate Kid: Legends” comes on the heels of the successful Netflix show “Cobra Kai.” For me, I love martial arts films. I grew up watching the movies of Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, Jet Li, and the list goes on and on. My favourite video game was “Mortal Kombat” (love the film from 1995 as well). And, I grew up learning Tae Kwon Do as well. So for me, Martial Arts has always been a big part of my upbringing. So, though I wasn’t excited for this film, it was a welcome watch. Here, we get a new underdog story, but, with a nice twist in the first half. Ironically, I actually bought in and thought we were actually going to get a spin on the “Karate Kid” formula. For a good section, the movie does a fantastic 180 turn, making the kid the sensei, and a middle aged father becoming the student and the possible karate subject. Well, there’s obviously love involved as the kid is in love with the father’s daughter, but it marked an interesting turn and subversion that I wasn’t expecting from this movie. Eventually, we do end up with the traditional beats of this franchise, and its in those portions where the film falters and becomes flawed. To save those tired beats, we are given a delightful treat in having franchise standouts in Chan and Macchio joining forces to help the kid train for the big tournament. Its a blast seeing these two legends on screen here, and they have a great camaraderie here as well. To be honest, Chan is in this film a lot more than I was presuming him to be, and Macchio feels more like an extended cameo than actual supporting role (he first appears nearly an hour into a 90 minute film). Ben Wang has a great future as an action star in my opinion, and though his acting could be better, his action skills are top notch. The action scenes here are cool and fun, and I love how the director has captured NYC here too. The philosophies based from and around martial arts is emphasized here in a great way, continuing the legacy of this practise from the previous films. Though this is a 90 minute film, I feel like a ton is happening here in quite rapid fashion. Not that I’m complaining about the film’s pacing, but, I feel like they could’ve let the film breathe a little here and there. Also, the antagonist is so cartoonish and caricatured. He just feels too on the nose and corny. But yeah, its always fun to see good martial arts action, and though Legends is more of a nice sendup for the series and fans of it, I wouldn’t say its anywhere near the original. Still though, its a fun summer film, and one that just breezes by. ",

    "title": "“Lilo and Stitch” Review: Best Live Action Disney Remake?",
    "selftext": "Disney’s newest live-action remake is “Lilo and Stitch”. I love the original movie, so I had to see it on opening weekend. Stitch is also my favorite Disney character, so I was hoping for big things despite the live-action remakes not having a great track record. This movie is directed by Dean Fleischer Camp while Maia Kealoha, Sydney Agudong, and Chris Sanders are the star actors. The plot is basically the same as the first one, but there were some minor changes.\n\nThe movie is very similar to the first one, so it made me feel like a kid again. The energy that Stitch brings is very chaotic and funny. However, this movie was more emotional than the first one from what I remember. I disagree with comments recently saying that Nani was going to give up Lilo. She tried her best to do what the social worker told her to do, but she failed due to many problems. If she was deemed not fit to parent, this is what would happen. She simply wanted the best for Lilo. The movie emphasized the broken family dynamic even more, and it certainly got me teary-eyed. The writing and the acting, especially, made this work really well.\n\nMaia Kealoha (Lilo) and Sydney Agudong (Nani) had a great dynamic as sisters. I wish we could have seen more of them as sisters. Nani often acted like a mom instead. Kealoha surprised me due to how great she was as Lilo. She made the movie come together. She worked well with Stitch and Nani, but she also had the chaotic side from the original. Chris Sanders also returns to voice Stitch, so Stitch translated very well to live action. The live action version is still cute and fluffy while being an absolute menace. \n\nThe live action remakes will never please everyone. People complain about the remakes being scene-for-scene copies. At the same time, they complain about the changes made. Everyone won’t be happy, but it is all about balance. This movie does well at doing new things, but there were some changes that disappointed me.\n\n  \nThe biggest was Jumba and Pleakley being in human disguises for most of the movie. I wanted to see their alien form. It creates funny moments. Jumba was also made into the villain which I didn’t like because that’s not who he was in the originals. In this one, he doesn’t become part of the family. Instead, Gantu should have still been the villain, but he was absent from the movie. The directors said it would be too hard and unrealistic, but Stitch is already unrealistic. Lastly, I wish we got a bigger actor for Bubbles. He is supposed to be big and intimidating while having a silly name like Bubbles. I saw a fan cast that fit very well, but I can’t remember who it was.\n\nAlthough there are some changes, I think *Lilo and Stitch* was a very good remake. It works very well as a family movie, and it has some emotional points. I highly recommend seeing this movie if you have kids or you are a fan of the original. I think I would still watch the original one over this. However, I could see a reason to turn this one on too.\n\n  \nFor Star Rating, check out my blog. \n\n[https://rtreviews4.wordpress.com/2025/05/27/lilo-and-stitch-review-best-live-action-disney-remake/](https://rtreviews4.wordpress.com/2025/05/27/lilo-and-stitch-review-best-live-action-disney-remake/)",

A part of me kind of wishes the kid found a way to sneak into the cabin room and lend Marilyn's character a helping hand from behind where she was trying to escape from. I'm sure it would've still turned out to be a funny scene regardless. What a missed opportunity it was for the kid actor and the directors.",

    "title": "The Phoenician Scheme (2025) Review: Wes Anderson’s Signature Aesthetic Meets Action, Comedy, and Surrealism",
    "selftext": "Read the full review and see our score here: [https://firstpicturehouse.com/the-phoenician-scheme-review-wes-andersons-signature-aesthetic-meets-action-comedy-and-surreal-spirituality/](https://firstpicturehouse.com/the-phoenician-scheme-review-wes-andersons-signature-aesthetic-meets-action-comedy-and-surreal-spirituality/)\n\nThis classic Wes Anderson-style film brings us yet another highly stylized aesthetic, quirky storytelling, and meticulous composition but this time, it’s an action movie. Fans of his work will find this one no less entertaining, fun, and visually pleasing. Yes, it follows a familiar formula. And yes, critics might argue he’s repeating himself. But it’s also true that we rarely fault directors for having a distinct voice, so why should Anderson be any different? In the case of *The Phoenician Scheme* – I went into it with the mindset of separating the film from the rest of his filmography.\n\nThe plot is as eccentric as you’d hope. The protagonist – a business tycoon, Zsa-zsa Korda (Benicio Del Toro), whose empire thrives on questionable practices like slave labour and induced famines, decides he needs an heiress to his business – his daughter Liesl (Mia Threapleton), a nun who’s understandably skeptical. Alongside a Norwegian bug tutor (for Zsa-zsa’s newfound hobby), Bjørn (Michael Cera), the trio must dodge assassination attempts while trying to reduce profit gaps by travelling to meet investors.\n\n*The Phoenician Scheme* starts with a bang. A bomb goes off on a plane, the pilot is ejected from the cockpit. Funny, unexpected. Zsa-zsa is entirely unbothered, and his composed absurdity is what makes his character so entertaining. He might be offering you a hand grenade or be on the verge of dying, but he remains the epitome of ‘calm under pressure.’ Perhaps the humour doesn’t land with everyone, but as a Brit, I certainly found the dry, deadpan delivery quite hilarious. His daughter Liesl is not much different, apart from her dedication to being a nun, of course.\n\nBoth Del Toro and Threapleton are delightful. We love to see another family dynamic that Wes Anderson brings us. Michael Cera, unapologetically and instantly enamoured with Liesl, is a great addition. He’s that quirky character we love to see. I’m sure many people will name him as a highlight.\n\nThe pastel colour palette is certainly enjoyable. While the topics of famine, assassinations, and espionage may seem to contradict the style, it’s that very style, along with the irony of the story, that makes it all the more comedic and entertaining. The deadpan comedy, combined with the aesthetically shot scenes and colour grading, makes for a good chuckle at the cinema and gives you plenty to look at in case the prolonged, deadpan dialogues begin to drag.\n\nAt times, I did find the dialogues a bit too long, with little entertainment between the laughs and the aesthetics. The film also doesn’t entirely hit the mark. Once it’s over, you’re left with a feeling that it could’ve been something more. Still, it’s an easy watch, although not revolutionary. A few cameos – Scarlett Johansson, Willem Dafoe, etc. bring big names to the box but mostly draw unnecessary attention to themselves in brief scenes. The film might’ve benefitted from fewer big names, as it occasionally edges into “too much-ness.” There are even a few scenes where Bill Murray plays God, and Zsa-zsa experiences spiritual awakenings between assassination attempts.",

    "title": "Sentimental Value (Cannes 2025) - My favorite of the festival",
    "selftext": "Following the breakout success of *The Worst Person in the World*, Joachim Trier returned to Cannes with *Sentimental Value*—the most anticipated film of the lineup. It was already being talked about as an awards frontrunner long before it premiered. And thankfully, Trier did not disappoint. This is his most mature, emotionally precise work yet: a powerful portrait of fractured families and the lasting scars left by parents on their children.\n\nLike *The Worst Person in the World*, it all rings remarkably true. Trier creates layered, flawed human beings and explores their relationships with empathy—showing their failures without taking sides, revealing their contradictions without judgment. Sentimental Value joins the tradition of films like Fellini’s *8½* and Spielberg’s *The Fabelmans*: not strictly autobiographical, but personal enough to turn the camera inward and confront the cost of making art. Though filmmaking isn’t the core of the movie, it hums quietly in the background, as Trier shows how the creative process can consume an artist—and quietly unravel those around them. Drawing from his own experience of becoming a parent, Trier uses this story to ask: what’s the emotional cost of putting art before everything else—of creating something that may live on forever and move strangers deeply, even as the artist slowly loses themselves in the process?\n\nHe explores that through the fractured family of Nora (Renate Reinsve), a stage actress in Oslo and the daughter of legendary director Gustav Borg (Stellan Skarsgård). Hoping to mount one final project, Gustav reaches out with a script based on the life of his own mother—a member of the Norwegian Resistance who was tortured during WWII and later died by suicide in the family home. Nora refuses. He casts a Hollywood actress, Rachel Kemp (Elle Fanning), instead. And with that, old wounds resurface and the house fills up with everything they haven’t said to each other.\n\nRead my full review at https://reviewsonreels.ca/2025/05/28/sentimental-vlue/\n\n**My Favorite Scene:** Two past collaborators realize that their relationship is over.",

    "title": "Moon Garden (2022), a New Fairy Tale Classic. 9 out of 10",
    "selftext": "Moon Garden is Ryan Stevens Harris second full length movie. Following a 5 year old girl as she traverses a twisted nightmare due to being in a coma. Being guided by her parents' voices while being chased by a monster. I'm going to try and not talk too much about things that will spoil the movie because this movie should be watched by all lovers of practical movies.\n\nDesign:\n\nRyan Stens Harris did not want to make a bland movie with CGI monsters and sets. Its very obvious that he is passionate about practical effects, puppets, and set design. With a style that reminds me of Mirror Mask and The City of Lost Children. A world is built that is like a fever dream and nightmare. Each set was unique and could you could see the craftsman ship in each peice. What I really enjoyed is a lot of the weird creations on set was made of things that a 5 year old could recognize but made into something different. This makes sense, since this land is inside her mind, so it would be made of things she recognizes. The puppets were amazing, inspired by stuffed animals and marionette puppets. Its a craft that is dying out by large CGI block busters made by Disney and Paramount. I like to see some CGI in some movies, but its too much now, its nice to see a movie rely on labor of set design. It makes me feel like I'm really experiencing what the character is experiencing cause it looks like both her and I can touch what is infront of us.\n\nCharacters: (Spoilers)\n\nI don't want to spoil the movie by talking about the other characters as they are the main drive of the movie. All I will say is that they are all mysterious in some way a sense of sadness to them and longing for love. I will talk about 4 characters that I think are very much given away in the trailer, Emma, Teeth, and the mom and dad. They aren't very fleshed out but have a large presence to them and a mystery behind them that you would like to know. Emma, the main character does exactly what a little girl would do in the situation. cry, laugh, get distracted, etc. Intrestingly she is played by the directors own daughter. For a child actress, with really no other credits to her name other than two shorts directed by her father, she does a superb job. Teeth is a very unique monster, sporting a conductors hat, a long trench coat and a jagged pair of dentures that are forever chattering in a dark pit in his face. He is the anatagonist of the film chasing Emma through this dream land. He has sort of the same rules as Freddy Kreuger, he can manipulate the land for fast access to where ever Emma is. A great monster that every one will feel uneasy watching. The last two I want to talk about is the mother and father, mainly their relationship. Emma is in the coma because of an argument between mom and dad as shown in the trailer. In the beginning you are to believe that the father is abusive and the mother is trying to take Emma away to saftey. Although as the movie goes on, you see that the mother is batteling poor mental health that is exacerbated by the fathers busy work schedule. The father even though is working a lot does try to spend as much of his free time with the two of them. The only time he is angry or yells is when he catches them trying to leave, even then he isn't too angry but more disappointed and worried. Maybe I missed something but the story seems to focus a lot on the mother's mental health.\n\nStory:\n\nThis movie has a great story. A small, scared, helpless little girl making her way through a land that is unfamiliar in every sense. The several characters point Emma in the right direction to get back home. Its a pretty well done story and one that many of us have seen before in other movies. Its a classic story that can be done multiple times with a creaters own design of a nightmare.\n\nOverall:\n\nI think this movie is unique and fantastic. I would give the movie a 9/10, some parts were a bit slow, but that is the point as well. The characters are intreging and make you want to learn more about them. The story is classic and what really brings everything together is the practical sets, costumes, and makeup. All beautifully done in a dark and twisted manner. If you enjoy movies like Mirror Mask or Pan's Labrynth, you should check this movie out.",

    "selftext": "At this point, as a general rule, and not entirely unwarranted, people have developed a tolerance to Wes Anderson. A fatigue, maybe, but definitely there are expectations that need surpassing for the average watcher to consider it “good”. The Phoenician Scheme does not defy expectations, but it is “good”. It is, cinematographically, gorgeous. Picture book-precise, planimetric, even a little flat, but it’s painterly and beautiful—to quote Zsa-Zsa Korda, the movie’s leading man, “don’t buy great art, buy masterpieces”. \n\nThat alone will win it some fans, especially on twitter, but it won’t win oscars. It has maybe one of the biggest casts all year—one that puts the new avengers movie to shame—but again, I’ll be surprised if it’s even nominated. Wes Anderson has done it before– made a beautiful movie, I mean– and better.\n\nStill, I’d like to make a case for The Phoenician Scheme, which left me thoroughly charmed, pleased, and content with the trip to the movies–and even life in general. After all, behind the pastels and deadpan deliveries, that’s what Wes Anderson movies are good for: A feeling of being in a picture book, a world where everything is neatly-organised, charming, and without much suffering– that everything is going to be ok. \n\nMore here (with footnotes :) )\nhttps://thephrasemaker.com/2025/05/28/the-phoenician-scheme-cures-wes-anderson-fatigue/",

Not every choice landed (the Holdo subplot is a mess), but he actually gave the story thematic weight and character arcs that went beyond surface-level nostalgia.\n\nI break down how Luke’s arc made sense as the story of a failed legend rediscovering purpose, how Rey’s origin as a “nobody” was actually the most powerful idea in the trilogy, and how Kylo Ren finally became more than just a Vader clone. I also cover Finn’s wasted potential, Rose’s unfair treatment, and why Poe’s arc, despite some rough writing, was one of the only real leadership journeys we got in the sequels.\n\nIf they had let Johnson handle all three films, we might have ended up with something truly great.\n\nHere’s the full post if you’re interested:  \n[https://medium.com/@wolfman1546/in-defense-of-rian-johnson-the-star-wars-film-that-actually-tried-88fb958ceaec](https://medium.com/@wolfman1546/in-defense-of-rian-johnson-the-star-wars-film-that-actually-tried-88fb958ceaec)\n\nThanks for reading, and I’d love to hear your thoughts.",

      "Just so you know, the link you posted doesn't work ",
      "I always thought TLJ was the best of the sequels. It's nowhere near as bad as the ROS and isn't nearly as unoriginal as TFA. Not that I LIKE any of the sequels, but I've never understood how it gets so much more hate than the others.",
      "I wonder how many folks that call TLJ trash also complain about Disney casting actors that dont look just like the cartoons. I think theyre the reason Marvel/Disney is making sure to bring back Downey Jr and the others. Because audiences want exactly what JJ tried to do with the first and third new trilogy of films, which is to hand you the same fuckin thing that is barely any different than the original. ",
      "Not to mention TLJ is the best looking Star Wars has ever been. \n\nHe should’ve done all 3 movies.",
      "What's funny is that I find it to be so refreshingly straightforward. \n\nTFA was very nostalgia heavy, whereas to me, TLJ was simply focused on fleshing the characters and moving the story forward regardless of how I felt about Star Wars growing up. I really appreciated that.",
      "It's one of the best movies in the franchise, but people were upset Luke was sad. \n\nLuke is more like himself in this movie than he is in Return of the Jedi. Dudes got it in their head that Buddhist monk from ROTJ was who he is. Luke is emotional. Human Always has been. \n\nThe Jedi also have a history of fleeing when down and out. Hell, practically EVERYONE does this when they lose.",
      "I have several issues with the first half of the movie, but everything from Rey entering the cave to the end is right up there with the best of Star Wars for me. ",
      "TFA was a retread trying to capture what ANH was like with decades of hindsight. A new death star was really lame, but I appreciated a lot about it, and the leads were great and had good chemistry. And then they even had a catwalk scene reminiscent of Empire, and it definitely felt very Star Wars.\n\nTLJ was so interesting because it was also kind of a retread of Empire, but I think in a way that was more thematic homage rather than imitation. Wasn't a fan of what they did with Finn, but I absolutely loved everything about Luke Skywalker. The fact that he had lived through genocide on a galactic scale and thought about ending his nephew's life to prevent it again worked for me. People watch these films and don't take the idea of sniffing out hundreds of billions of lives as something very serious because it happens offscreen, but it's something to think about. Anyway, the film had the Yoda dynamic, and even a scene where they're in a ROTJ throne room where the hero is watching their friends about to be destroyed. A little bonus final setpiece where we see a new type of planet that was visually interesting as well. And Luke scoffing at the idea of jumping around with his laser sword to then standing alone in front of the First Order had me thinking, holy shit is he gonna do it? And what actually happens is he puts on perhaps the most powerful display of the Force that has ever occurred in the entire history of their galaxy in order to save his friends, and gives his life for it. I've always teared up at his final scene because it's so powerful, and Mark Hamill does such a great job all the way through.\n\nWalking out of that film, I thought \"well, they've remixed everything they could from the original trilogy. I'm so excited to see where the next film goes because it could literally be anything! New stuff! What a time to be alive!\" 😂 oh boy lol",
      "The only part of it that I didn't like was Luke's reason for being alone on the island.  Just as Mark Hamill said, it wasn't in his character to hide away like that.  But in the end I didn't really care because we got to have Luke being the wise old grumpy sage which was a lot of fun. \nGhost Yoda?  Yes please.",
      "I find it hilarious that TLJ was panned by fans then when we got ROS everyone was like “actually….”",
      "The Last Jedi was awesome",
      "TLJ is evidence that star wars fans are deeply unserious people. These are the people who supposedly love Star Wars yet get offended when someone points out it's made for 12 year olds due to insecurity, since something made for children doesn't make something bad or even shallow. They'll talk about how they want a star wars for grown ups but what they really mean is they want it to be some gorey, dark, gritty war drama for some reason even tho Star Wars has always been, because it is made for 12 year olds, goofy and optimistic. So then here comes Rian Johnson who makes a Star Wars movie that is as PG as the first three movies but also  challenges the fandom by making a movie about how you can't keep repeating the same ideas over and over and hope things will get better, how we need to let go of our past and our nostalgia so that we may be better people. One that makes explicit a military-industrial-complex showing that these wars are not only pointless but actively make shitty people richer, all while still being a goofy and optimistic Star Wars movie. And the fans fucking hated it and still cry about it to this day because, after decades of demanding a grown up Star Wars movie a grown made a movie telling them they need to let their nostalgia go to be better people.",
      "The best out of the three sequels IMO. It tried to be its own thing. The other two were just trying to rehash previous plot points. The first one was a creatively bankrupt nostalgia bait movie made in the boardroom and the last one was a damage control attempt to recapture the first movie.",
      "Agreeeeeeeeeee!!!!",
      "It can be both trash and the first time Star Wars actually tried something new. And it is.",
      "It’s definitely the best of that trilogy, though that’s not a very high bar. ",
      "Originality can still suck.\n\n\nTake for instance the beginning, forget about the prank call, Poe Dameron IGNORES ORDERS and is responsible for the deaths of his squadron and is mad he gets demoted.. leadership story or not, he was already the best pilot in the resistance, that arc for him is awkward.\n \nFinn and Rose go to Canto Bight to find a code breaker, but they find another in a jail cell right away and fully trust him? what?..\n\n\nAnd of course all the fake outs and takeaways. Leia is blasted into the vacuum of space but floats back in and is just out a while then totally fine? it was emotional showing kylo unable to make the shot then it means nothing, same  with the Rose crash of course. He faked out an ironing board instead of a landing ship (corny). And the biggest sin of all was taking a huge massive dump on the hopeful lightside of the force jedi master, Luke Skywalker who uses a Jedi projection device and dies? If Luke can't use that thing without dying who can? And dude, there's an XWing with lightspeed right there under the water! You introduce it Rian! JJ does it later but wtf have Luke come save the day and train Rey in ep9 properly. Mark Hamill was up for it!\n\n\nRian made so many bothersome choices in his \"originality\" that ruin any positivity for me in the kinda cool things he added.",
      "Tried something new, still trash.",
      "Sure. I just didn’t like a lot of those ideas. I hated learning that our hero Luke is actually lonely depressed and broken, and dies alone on a far off planet. \n\nI loved everything kylo ren. But the whole slow speed chase through space was boring as hell. \n\nIt was the first Star Wars movie my wife agreed to watch with me in theatres and she was bored to tears through the whole thing. \n\nI remember leaving feeling nothing. ",
      "Second time.\n\nRogue One.\n\nArguably 3rd time, as doing another after the original had never been done.",
      "The first time Star Wars tried something new? Did you miss the Prequels? Did you miss Empire and Return?\n\nTLJ tried SOME new things but it still comes across as retreading the OT just with different results. Having a stunning reveal of a character's origin is still a stunning reveal when it turns out to be \"nobody.\" Having a a dramatic confrontation to turn a character back to the light is the same even when they refuse to turn. TLJ wasn't anything new when you take a step back and examine it with any degree of objectivity.",
      "The reason people like me hate The Last Jedi is that all it cared about was “trying something new” and in doing so it failed to set up Episode IX. It would’ve been one thing if the trilogy started with “trying something new”, but it didn’t. Instead, TFA set up traditional Star Wars expectations, TLJ subverted those expectations, and the trilogy was left with nowhere to go. \n\nFor all the TLJ defense I’ve seen, I’ve never heard a good explanation of how Episode IX could have built on TLJ and finished the trilogy successfully. TLJ doomed Episode IX’s fate.",
      "*The Last Jedi*  being trash and Star Wars trying something new are not mutually exclusive occurrences. Both can be, and are, true.",
      "The sequels are all bad, but the blame lies with TFA. Just not a strong start. Honestly, the themes presented in TLJ would have been interesting and refreshing if allowed to be explored over an entire trilogy. \n\nStill, there are \"yo mama\" jokes in the first 5 minutes. Iowa isn't THAT corny.",
      "The Last Jedi, whether you like it or not, was the middle movie of a trilogy. Outside of the choices Rian wanted to go with the story, it neither built on the plot points of TFA nor gave narrative momentum with new plot points for ROS. It failed spectacularly as a trilogy centerpiece and did little to advance or explain any character outside of Kylo Ren.",
      "I would have been ok with Rian Johnson trying something new if there was a cohesive storyline building to something and if he didn’t abandon many of the themes and character development from before. And the entire “we ran out of gas” storyline should have lasted five minutes, or not been included at all. I walked out of the movie very angry and as a result I didn’t bother watching Episode 9.",
      "Sure, it tried new things like:\n- Breaking the story mechanics of hyperspace travel.\n- Trying to make a very slow chase interesting.\n- Making the enemy so stupid they couldn't figure out that they could jump ahead of the ship they were chasing, or just hyperspacing one of thier own ships through the rebel ship - since that's a thing now. \n- Having a dumb side plot that had zero effect on the main story. \n- Making previously interesting characters into idiots. \n- Making previously loved characters into assholes for no reason.",
      "It tried something new for the first half of the movie, then went back to tried and true.",
      "I liked the Last Jedi, and recall a good cinema experience. Hardly trash.\nIt's at worst decent.\n\nBut nothing in that movie is very original.\nIf you can get past that you will be fine.\n\nThe more you watch it.\nThe more you see.\nIt was a bastardization of old EU material and recycled elements of the Empire Strikes Back script.\nSafe retread just like TFA.\nEnd goal to Kill off Luke.\nNot a good direction imo.\nBut also not unexpected.\n\nAlso the director was such a baby.\nTrying to bait and antagonise fans.\nStarted the worst trend.",
      "no, it was trash.",
      "It tried something new… that was trash. lol",
      "Something new? It was nothing more than a remake of The Empire Strikes Back.",
      "It had an amazing premise, but was a terrible movie. It's the opposite of Rise of Skywalker, which had a trash premise but ended up being pretty enjoyable.",
      "Have you only seen the movies?",
      "Thanks for the heads up. I fixed it.",
      "I watched all 3 again - and last Jedi felt like it was building towards something epic \n\nWith ROS it goes off the rails - an amalgamation of nostalgia and fan pleasing, while racing to the finish line. \n\nRos has its moments but it’s a mess.",
      "Totally agree. the visual storytelling in TLJ is unreal. The throne room fight? That hyperspace shot? Even the little moments... Luke walking out to face the First Order with the twin suns behind him, absolutely stunning.\n\nAnd yeah, give Johnson the trilogy and we’d be talking about Star Wars in a completely different way right now.\n\nAppreciate you checking it out.",
      "Amen, brother!",
      "People were upset he tried to kill his nephew",
      "Weird that Mark Hamill disagrees with this assessment.",
      "Exactly! Thank  you!",
      "I agree for most of that. Where I differ is that  I did feel like their explanation for why he chose that path made sense though.",
      "That's why pandering to them is pointless.",
      "TLJ didn’t fail to be Star Wars. It failed to flatter the part of the fandom that wants grown-up aesthetics but not grown-up ideas.\n\nRian Johnson gave us a movie that’s still PG, still hopeful, still full of weird creatures and space battles, but dared to say, \"maybe nostalgia isn’t always the answer.\" It took a swing at legacy worship, at war profiteering, at the Jedi’s own mythologized failure, and still managed to end on a note of hope.\n\nBut for a lot of fans, that wasn’t mature enough. Because what they actually wanted wasn’t emotional maturity. It was more lightsabers, more explosions, and a hero that made them feel safe. TLJ made them uncomfortable, and instead of sitting with that, they called it bad.",
      "Nobody hates Star Wars fans like Star Wars fans.",
      "Ah, yes. The bold contribution of repeating a take two others already made with no added insight. Genuinely impressive how fast “original” can become boilerplate.",
      "Appreciate the response, but I think we’re using “new” in different ways.\n\nYes, the prequels expanded the lore and introduced tons of new concepts. And the OT, especially Empire, pushed the story into deeper territory. No argument there.\n\nBut within the sequel trilogy, TLJ was the only film that tried to break from the formula. It didn’t just remix the OT, it deliberately flipped expectations. The “nobody” reveal for Rey matters because the setup made you expect another Skywalker twist. Kylo killing Snoke matters because it happens mid-trilogy, not at the end. Luke refusing the hero’s call and resolving the final conflict without violence? That’s a massive departure from the Jedi-as-warrior arc.\n\nYou can say it uses familiar beats, but TLJ’s whole thing was taking those beats and saying, “what if this went another way?” That’s not the same as just copying the OT and changing the names.\n\nAlso, if we’re calling TLJ unoriginal for doing twists within familiar setups, we’d have to say the same for TFA, which literally mirrors A New Hope beat for beat, and yet doesn’t get nearly the same level of grief for it.\n\nNot saying you have to love the movie. Just saying “it wasn’t new” doesn’t really hold up under a deeper look.",
      "TLJ does feel like a sharp pivot from what TFA set up. But to me, that’s not on TLJ alone. That’s on the fact that Lucasfilm didn’t have a unified plan for the trilogy from day one. You had two different directors with totally different visions and no roadmap to tie it all together.\n\nThat’s why I argued in the blog post that if Rian Johnson had been in charge from the beginning, the trilogy would have had a more coherent throughline. TLJ only “doomed” Episode IX because Abrams chose to throw everything out and scramble to course correct. But there were real threads to build on: Rey finding identity without a legacy, Kylo fully stepping into power, the Resistance becoming more of a movement than a military.\n\nJohnson handed IX a chance to take Star Wars somewhere new. Abrams chose to take it backward instead.",
      "I still don't understand what was new about TLJ. It didn't follow through on anything that TFA had set up and gave us nothing in return. How is that new?",
      "> The reason people like me hate The Last Jedi is that all it cared about was “trying something new” and in doing so it failed to set up Episode IX.\n\nThis is it in a nutshell. \n\nIt was Act II of a three-act story.   And instead of ending on a clear crisis, it ended with a whimper. And killed off what was touted as a major antagonist, with no clear replacement.  And disregarded much of Act I.  \n\nThe whole Sequel Trilogy was a hot mess: TFA was a retread of Episode 4, TLJ wanted to be the cool kid that did something edgy and ignored inconvenient stuff that came before, ROS was a \"nuh-uh\" move by the TFA director to ignore much of TLJ.  \n\nAnd all three movies would have been elevated by an adult in charge making sure that a coherent story was told throughout.  But apparently that was a bridge too far.",
      "I’m all for \"both things can be true,\" but I think the second half of that sentence deserves a little more scrutiny.\n\nIf we're calling it \"pretty bad,\" the question is... bad how? Incoherent plot? Weak character arcs? Poor performances? Or was it just \"not what I wanted from a Star Wars movie\"?\n\nBecause when you break it down, TLJ had tight direction, strong performances (Hamill especially), and actual character development. Not just nostalgia and fan service. You don’t have to like the direction it went. That’s fair. But that’s not the same as saying it was poorly made.\n\nTrying something new doesn’t automatically make it good. But “it felt wrong to me” doesn’t automatically make it bad either.",
      "A lot of what you’re listing here honestly could apply just as easily to the original trilogy if you look at it with the same lens.\n\nHyperspace rules have always been inconsistent. A New Hope had Han dodging planets mid-jump without sensors, and ROTJ had ships jumping into combat at Endor with zero prep. TLJ didn’t break hyperspace, it just visualized a suicide move no one's been reckless enough to try before.\n\nThe slow chase isn't that different from Empire’s “hide in an asteroid field until the plot progresses” structure. It’s a pressure-cooker setup that gave characters space for conflict, whether you liked how that was used is fair game, but it's not fundamentally new or broken.\n\nAs for the villains being dumb, the Empire built a second Death Star with the another huge flaw. Star Wars bad guys have never been strategic geniuses.\n\nThe Canto Bight subplot didn’t hit for a lot of people, I get that. But ROTJ spends 30 minutes with a plan that involves Leia getting caught on purpose, Chewie getting imprisoned, Luke showing up late, and everyone hoping Jabba doesn’t just kill them on sight. It’s not exactly airtight.\n\nLuke being bitter and lost after failing his own student is a far cry from being an “asshole for no reason.” That was the whole point, he let his legend swallow him and had to claw his way back. That's character development, even if it's uncomfortable.\n\nTLJ has issues, no doubt. But holding it to a hyper-logical standard while giving the OT a free pass for the same kinds of storytelling leaps feels a little selective.",
      "I get the concern over TLJ pulling from familiar material, but I’d argue the point wasn’t to invent completely new concepts. It was to take what Star Wars had always leaned on and challenge it. Luke refusing the call. The big bad getting killed mid-trilogy. The lead character’s power not coming from her bloodline. That’s not a retread. That’s narrative subversion.\n\nAs for it being a “bastardization” of the EU, I don't see it. Luke going into exile after failure might echo a few old stories, but TLJ doesn’t lift from any specific plot-line. It creates its own thematic weight. The film isn’t trying to copy the EU. It’s trying to dismantle the idea that legacy is what makes someone powerful in the Force.\n\nIt’s also a stretch to say TLJ copied Empire. Beyond being the middle chapter, the plot and structure are completely different. There’s no Vader twist, no carbonite, no Cloud City betrayal, no Boba Fett. Instead, we get a Resistance on the run, a mutiny subplot, and a villain who doesn’t follow his master but kills him and tries to reshape the galaxy his own way. That’s not copy-paste. That’s a thematic shake-up.\n\nAnd just to be clear, I know you didn’t say this, but in the broader fandom it’s strange how The Force Awakens gets acknowledged as a soft remake of A New Hope, but rarely gets the same kind of heat for it. People say “yeah, it was familiar, but it felt right.” But when The Last Jedi flips the formula on its head, suddenly “not being original enough” becomes a mortal sin. That double standard makes it hard to have a consistent conversation about what we actually expect from Star Wars.\n\nAs for Luke’s death, it wasn’t some cynical kill-off. He dies projecting himself across the galaxy to save what little hope is left. He doesn’t fight with a lightsaber. He uses the Force as a shield, literally and thematically. I just cant agree that it's in any way a sign of disrespect. \n\nLastly, the Rian Johnson “antagonizing fans” bit gets thrown around a lot, but it’s mostly reactionary. He made a few sarcastic tweets in response to bad-faith hate campaigns and toxic backlash, but most of the narrative that he was some arrogant provocateur was built by YouTubers who profit off outrage. TLJ didn’t “start the trend.” The trend was already in full swing after TFA when Boyega and Ridley got dogpiled online for even existing.\n\nHappy to hear disagreement, I just think the criticism should match what was actually in the film.",
      "The theme and message of the movie is “time to try something new”. I think a lot of people internalise that as the movie itself doing something new, which it doesn’t really.\n\nEven when it gestures at doing something daring it ends up pulling back and reverting back to formula. \n\nBy the end, the status quo has been all but reset back to square one - Empire vs Rebels forever more - rather than having been sent in an exciting new direction.\n\nI never got why the idea of Rey being a nobody is in any way new or radical. *Luke* was a backwater nobody in the original movies - that was the whole point!\n\nJyn in Rogue One was a nobody. Finn was a nobody and lots of fans widely assumed he was going to wind up a Jedi until it turned out they had no clue what to do with him.\n\nThe only reason there was a negative reaction to Rey being a nobody was because the first movie was full of nods and winks heavily implying her backstory was significant, which made the reveal feel like one of several unceremoniously dropped plot threads.\n\nProbably the most interesting of the sequel trilogy, yes, but at the end of the day it adds up to very little.",
      "ROS was terrible. The worst of the three.",
      "You guys are being sarcastic right? \n\n\nRight?",

      "He didn't TRY to kill his nephew, he THOUGHT about it. For about 3 seconds \n\nHe did, however, try to kill Vader. Multiple times. \n\nThis is a fanbase who tries to portray Anakin, the mass murderer, as some tragic hero. A victim. But Luke can't think about something.",
      "Reddit: \"Well, what does Mark Hamill know about Star Wars?!\"",
      "I don't give a fuck what Mark Hamill agrees with.",
      "Yeah that's also true.  It did make sense.  I guess it just contrasts so hard with how much effort he put into staying good and not going to the dark side in the original trilogy, that for him to see the darkness in his nephew and then that completely destroys him was a little far fetched.  But then again, in the original trilogy he is young.  After a few decades people become less idealistic.  Maybe they should have thrown in a comment about that, the difference in age.  \nBut anyway yeah it was still good enough for me, didn't ruin the movie.",

      "He’s not wrong.",
      "Yes if you say \"new\" doesn't mean new then you are correct. In the microcosm of the Sequels sure TLJ is the most unique, but your claim is \"It Was the First Time Star Wars Actually Tried Something New\", a laughably absurd statement. The nobody revel could have worked if TFA or ROS supported it what-so-ever. Moving Kylo killing Snoke to mid-trilogy, doesn't make it new or unique, it very literally is the \"changing the names\" complaint. Luke resolving the final conflict without violence? That's literally how Return of the Jedi ends!   \n  \nIt wasn't new holds SO much water that your essentially saying they are the same beats but with a different result, which isn't something new. Tying to use TFA as a shield won't help when someone points of that they're both OT retreads. TFA gets so much grief for being a remake of ANH, it's literally everyone's complaint about it.",

That’s drive-by commenting.\n\nYou didn’t read the thread. You didn’t engage with what was written. You repeated a line others already said, added nothing to the discussion, and now you’re pretending that’s some mic-drop moment. It’s not.\n\nIf you want to disagree, great.

      "You're really bending over backward to miss the context here.\n\nWhen I said “new,” I wasn’t claiming TLJ invented storytelling or was completely disconnected from the OT. I was pointing out that within the sequel trilogy, it was the only entry that attempted to shift the thematic and narrative structure in a meaningful way. It used familiar setups to deliver different messages, and that’s still a departure.\n\nYou’re calling it a “laughably absurd” statement, but the entire point was about trajectory. TLJ handed IX a galaxy where legacy didn’t determine power, where the villain was in charge without a bigger bad behind him, and where the Jedi idea was being redefined. That setup could have gone somewhere, if there was a plan.\n\nAnd if we’re being honest, you're kind of proving my point. If TLJ is just “the same as ROTJ,” and TFA is “just ANH again,” then where exactly was this trilogy ever supposed to go? That’s not TLJ’s fault. That’s on the trilogy being built backwards with no roadmap.",
      "Totally fair, and I actually agree with some of that. Honestly, it's funny you bring up the pacing, humor, and dead-end arcs. I call all that out in the blog itself. I never claimed TLJ was perfect. Just that it tried something bold, and parts of it hit harder than it’s often given credit for.\n\nI think we probably land in a similar spot. The movie swings big, but the execution is hit or miss. I just lean more toward respecting the intent, even when it stumbles.\n\nEither way, I really appreciate you taking the time to lay out your thoughts instead of just tossing out a meme or a one-liner.

      "He was in 1977. Decades of twists and prequels and lore might've retroactively turned him into more than that, but \"some random kid from the middle of nowhere becomes a galactic hero\" is literally what the original Star Wars is about, so I don't buy that it was a revolutionary move to try the same thing 40 years later.\n\nIf they'd just gone ahead and done that, no one would've cared.

I'm not bending over backwards to miss the context, you're just creating a context in which \"Star Wars\" only means the sequel trilogy. If you're \"entire point\" is about trajectory then say something like \"The Last Jedi set up Star Wars to explore something completely new.\" That's not what you said though. You're just moving the goalposts to try and save face. \n\nYou're the one being dishonest trying to defend TLJ from being called trash, trying to cast it as a boldly creative vision. My point is that TLJ is a mishmash of ROTJ and ESB, and no it did not have to be that way. It's entirely TLJ's fault for being what it is, not TFA's. You can't simultaneously fault TFA for being ANH and then turn around and claim that TLJ being like ESB+ROTJ is actually being \"ambitious.\" \n\nHow was the trilogy \"built backwards\"?

    "selftext": "What I liked most about *The Amateur* is that it doesn’t recycle the same formula that countless other male revenge thrillers have used for ages.  The hero of this movie isn’t a former secret agent/black ops/paramilitary soldier with expert knowledge of weaponry and lethal hand-to-hand combat skills.  Not that I have anything against those movies, which are fun in a “how’s he going to kill this group of heavily armed guys” sort of way.  But aside from who’s dishing out the bloody  justice they tend to suffer from a feeling of sameness.\n\n*The Amateur*, however, features a hero who fits the classical definition of a wimp.  (Is calling someone a wimp permitted these days?)  Played by Academy Award-winning actor Rami Malek, the only threatening thing about him is his brain, which he uses to take down the bad guys who “fridged” his wife.  As such, Malek turns out to be the perfect representative for today’s computer-savvy professionals.  He’s neither physically fit nor handsome, but could end you with a few keystrokes.\n\nAside from its very non-traditional leading man, the movie does fall back on the elements that make movies like these so much fun.  There are regular changes of scenery (Paris, Istanbul, Madrid, Romania, the Baltic Sea) and a who’s who supporting cast.  Rachel Brosnahan, the former Mrs. Maisel and upcoming romantic interest for a gent named Superman, plays the ill-fated wife.  Instead of having her disappear after her first act demise, the movie has her float in and out of the hero’s consciousness like William Wallace’s wife in *Braveheart*.  Caitríona Balfe brings a world-weary sadness to her informant character.  Julianne Nicholson has a couple of good scenes as the “over her head” CIA director.\n\nOn the male side of the cast, Laurence Fishburne is as funny as he is imposing.  Holt McCallany plays another devious government agent.  Michael Stuhlbarg appears in the end to good effect, delivering a villain monologue with the cold, dispassionate inflections of a lifelong killer for hire.  Jon Bernthal only appears in two scenes and steals them so easily that I wished he was around more.\n\n*The Amateur* is an entertaining alternative to the “one man wrecking crew” films.  It uses Rami Malek’s geeky nature to good effect and the supporting cast are all solid.  The movie doesn’t reinvent the spy thriller or the revenge fantasy but offers an interesting take on both.  A well-made and entertaining film.  **Recommended**.\n\n[https://detroitcineaste.net/2025/05/27/the-amateur-movie-review-and-analysis-rami-malek-rachel-brosnahan/](https://detroitcineaste.net/2025/05/27/the-amateur-movie-review-and-analysis-rami-malek-rachel-brosnahan/)",

    "selftext": "Yes, the movie’s funny. But I was trying to think about what separates the great Wes Anderson movies from the ones that are just amusing, because they’re always at least that. I think a big part of it is how well the movie succeeds in everything aside from the comedy, because there’s usually some idea or feeling–however vague–that Anderson is exploring.\n\nFor example, Moonrise Kingdom does a great job of capturing the feeling of being a kid, how everything is a new adventure at that age. Asteroid City, on the other hand, attempts to explore some general existential stuff and I don’t think that part of the movie worked.\n\nThe Phoenician Scheme explores the relationship between a rich, atheist father and his modest, nun daughter, and how they gradually come to meet in an unlikely middle. Despite a complete lack of sentimentality–a trademark of Anderson’s that I’ve never appreciated until now–he still manages to make these cartoonish characters and their relationship affecting and believable.\n\nMy full review on YouTube: [https://youtu.be/Z9VYB03LZqs](https://youtu.be/Z9VYB03LZqs)",

    "selftext": "https://youtube.com/shorts/VWNGBP9koVs?feature=shared\n\nBring Her Back - 8.5/10. Got to see this at an advanced screening, so thanks for the opportunity! Still haven’t seen “Talk To Me” yet, so I went into this blindly, not knowing what to expect. First and foremost I gotta say this: Sally Hawkins is an amazing performer. I was wondering to myself as to why she had picked this as a project she wanted to be a part of. And once you get to the second half of the film, you’ll understand why. She delivers a great performance here, and makes it greater with the chilling circumstances of the story. One of my biggest pet peeves about film marketing is when they say bold statements like “so scary it will haunt you in your sleep,” or, “a movie so scary it will scar you.” This movie is super solid, and delivers a very solid punch, but as a person who doesn’t scare easily in films, this film was more disgusting than scary. “Bring Her Back” should be billed more as a psychological/emotional drama, with bouts of disgusting and disturbing imagery. The film is rich in atmosphere, and considering its happening mostly around this specific home, the directors do a great job of building the suspense and intrigue. The commentary here is the grief that comes when a loved one dies, and the ability (or the extreme inability) to move on from the death. Its a film that shows you the lengths that one would go to bring back a loved one (no matter how disturbing the consequences that come along with the situation). There’s some gross body horror like scenes here, and some of the sequences in the second half are pretty well done in terms of amping the suspense and intrigue in the story. Also, funny how the directors were able to throw in both of their film names into the dialogue here. Overall, a very solid film, buoyed by great performances and atmosphere. Wouldn’t say its scary, but its super effective!",

Following his roles in [*Meg 2: The Trench*](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/meg-2-the-trench-movie-2023/) and *The Beekeeper*, Statham trades giant sea monsters and bee-themed vengeance for a more grounded but also more generic revenge setup.

His attempts to gain custody of his daughter Merry—who has lived with her grandfather since the suicide of Levon’s wife—form the only real emotional thread. The closest thing he has to a family is the Garcia clan, his construction employers and close friends: Joe (Michael Peña), Carla (Noemi Gonzalez), and their daughter Jenny (Arianna Rivas). But when Jenny is abducted one night by Russian traffickers, Levon is pulled back into violence at the Garcias’ desperate request.\n\n[More Movies Like 'A Working Man'](https://cinephilecorner.com/lists/movies-like-a-working-man/)",

    "selftext": "[**Totenfrau or Woman of the Dead**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/woman-of-the-dead-netflix-series-review) is one of those rare series that has so many things going for it, from stylized action pieces to gore as a plot device, and breathtaking cinematography with edge-of-your-seat thrills.\n\nIt's a raw, unrefined revenge series that's executed to perfection, so much so that it reminds me of [**Paul Verhoeven's**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/classic-paul-verhoeven-movies-to-celebrate-halloween) Robocop. Although there are nuances to the plotline, such as the lead's complicated family history, her personality type, and how she's trying to keep her family together while investigating her husband's death.\n\n**TMJ Rating: 🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿/ 5**\n\n*Disclaimer: This series contains a lot of violence, gore, and other mature themes.*\n\n# The Plot of Woman of the Dead Season 2\n\nThe second season opens with Blum's combat training with her friend Reza for whatever contingency may arise, considering what she was up to in the last season and the sinister, wealthy, powerful, and morally bankrupt people she is investigating.\n\nAfter avenging the murder of her husband in Woman of the Dead Season 1, and unearthing a human trafficking ring that is used as a source of victims for mindless torture and murder, as in the movie [**Hostel**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2Kfp3zVBKs)**.**\n\nThe second season of Woman of the Dead, or Totenfrau, deals with the aftermath of all the violence that took place in the first season, which begins when the cops unearth the remains of Edwin Schönborn, Johanna's son, which kicks up all kinds of dirt.\n\nThings come to a head when Blum's daughter is dragged into this hot mess, kicking and screaming. This quickly changes Blum's focus from revenge to rescue, possibly compounded revenge, and scorched Earth on whoever threatens her family.\n\n# The Cast of Totenfrau, Woman of the Dead Season 2\n\nAnna Maria Mühe as Brünhilde Blum basically anchors the entire show with her performance playing the incredibly complex character of a mother with a weirdly intense profession, trying to keep her family safe while tangling with some unsavory people to solve and even avenge her husband's killer.\n\nEmilia Pieske as Nela Thaler does a great job of acting as Brünhilde Blum's teenage daughter, who is trying to figure out life as any kid would at that age, saddled with the additional burden of her father's [**murder**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/netflix-mini-series-the-residence-review). Tristán López as Alex Schönborn plays the nephew of Johanna Schönborn, who is dating Nela, Blum's daughter.\n\nBritta Hammelstein as Majorin Birgit Wallner plays a cop hot on the trail of criminals in her quest for justice, with her acting in another series that leans more towards a comedic premise in [**Murder Mindfully**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/murder-mindfully-netflix-series-review). She is one hell of an actress, and I'm sure we will see much more of her in [**international cinema**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/yannick-movie-2023-quentin-duplieux). For some reason, she reminds me of an edgier version of Kate McKinnon.\n\nMichou Friesz as Johanna Schönborn plays the silent yet deadly matriarch of the Schönborn [**business empire**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/how-to-sell-drugs-online-fast-series-review), dealing with the death of her son, and fighting an uphill battle to build a resort that will bolster their business holdings and grow beyond its current holdings. She's mourning the untimely death of her son while processing her anger towards whoever may or may not be responsible for her son's death.\n\nIf Yousef Sweid as Reza Shadid, looks familiar, it is because her has also acted in [**The Spy (2019)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UijUOy0MmE) and [**American Assassin (2017)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9rNf-cLWKU) in supporting roles. His mysterious-looking eyes and stoic demeanour are perfect for the role of Blum's confidant, combat trainer, and protector.\n\nPeter Kurth as Badal Sarkissian plays one of the Big Bads in this series, with him definitely getting the archetypal villain look right, along with his cold acting does which completes the look. Sarkissian is the owner of a shady business and is also in bed with the Schönborns, which basically isn't good news at all for anyone.\n\nRobert Palfrader as Wilhelm Danzberger plays the cop who might be in league with the Schönborns, but is investigating the series of disappearances and rash of assaults and even possible [**murders**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/only-murders-in-the-building-bridging-boomers-and-millennials-with-a-sensible-whodunnit) that are occurring in quick succession.\n\n# Cinematography\n\nThe cinematography is once again breathtaking, showing us the resort of Kühtai, the Ötztal Valley, and the Venet mountain along with the Austrian Tyrol. The lighting as well as sound design, is beyond impressive, adding to the plot significantly and elevating it to a higher standard of storytelling in general.\n\nThe background score is pretty epic, along with the intro graphics that go hand-in-glove to generate deep thriller vibes. At first glance, it looks pretty simple to create a thrilling background score and intro and riding visuals with matching intensity, but I'm pretty sure a lot of work went into making this thriller feel legitimate, human, and not gratuitous or over the top with the [**violence**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/squid-game-netflix-series) and [**gore**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/gen-v-series-review).\n\nThe way Blum suits up to ride her dead husband's bike reminds me slightly of the [**Street Hawk**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Hawk) [**80s series**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/80s-and-90s-tv-shows-usa), but with the heavy and intense vibe ( If [**Dexter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQeUmSD1c3g) were relatively sane ), the slow, intentional pacing of intro music is what makes it so awesome.\n\n# Should You Watch It? Definitely!\n\nWatch Woman of the Dead Season 2 for the intense thriller vibes, a human perspective on someone in trouble, near flawless lighting, sound design, and background score, but mostly for the amazing execution of all plot elements into a cohesive storytelling experience that blows your socks off.\n\n***Like this review?*** [**Subscribe**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/contact) ***to*** [**themoviejunkie.com**](http://themoviejunkie.com/)***!***",

    "selftext": "dir. Julia Ducournau\nstarring. Tahar Rahim, Golshifteh Farahani, Mélissa Boros\n\nJulia Ducournau returned to the Cannes Film Festival in 2025 with great expectations on her shoulders, following the Palme d’Or-winning and fantastically disturbing Titane (2021). This time, she arrives with a more grounded, personal film that still carries her signature body horror aesthetics—but trades high-concept shock for something more emotionally resonant. Alpha draws allegorical parallels to the AIDS epidemic of the 1980s, imagining a world where the infected slowly turn into marble statues. It’s a film that touches on societal paranoia, coming-of-age in the shadow of illness, and the intimate bonds between those affected, wrapped in surreal imagery that only Ducournau could conjure.\n\nThe film is roughly divided into two halves. The first focuses on the spreading paranoia around Alpha, a teenage girl who may have contracted a mysterious illness after getting a tattoo at a party. This portion taps into the fears of her schoolmates, teachers, and especially her mother—a doctor who treats infected patients and whose brother is already living with the disease. The second half shifts gears toward something quieter and more introspective, centering on the family’s emotional reckoning, the infected’s search for meaning, and the slow process of letting go.\n\nThe two parts don’t blend seamlessly, but they’re compelling in their own right. The tension in the first half is palpable, with standout moments like the chaos at Alpha’s school pool or blood dripping onto a projected image—both extremely striking and memorable. It also does a great job establishing Alpha as a character and grounding her in a world full of fear, fragility, and misunderstanding.\n\nThe more meditative second half feels a bit weaker by comparison—more abstract and emotionally distant—but it’s elevated by three excellent central performances. Tahar Rahim, in particular, is quietly devastating, and the film finds real tenderness in his arc. The mother, however, is sidelined for much of the final act, which slightly detracts from the emotional payoff. Still, when a key moment finally lands, it lands hard.\n\nRead my full review at https://reviewsonreels.ca/2025/05/25/alpha/",

You can actually feel for them as they overcome their obstacles and struggles, with Nate using his medical disorder to his advantage for the movie's conflict. And Ray Nicholson literally played the big bad of the film, Simon, so well, that you can't help but actually love to hate him because of his heinous acts. The movie deftly blended action, humor, romance, and heart amidst all the bloody scenes. If you're able to stomach the violence and gore, you'll find that the movie has a sweet side to it alongside a good dash of character focus. Anyways, that's my review for this film.  ",

They don’t crumble. They don’t sob into the floor like a child. And maybe that’s what stardom demands—a perfectly polished, never-cracked image. Maybe vulnerability doesn’t test well in IMAX. But *Magnolia* is proof that Cruise doesn’t have to play it safe to be magnetic. In fact, he’s *more* captivating when he lets the cracks show. In [*Jerry Maguire*](https://www.peliplat.com/en/library/movie/pp12654211/jerry-maguire), he gave us glimpses of this vulnerability. In [*Eyes Wide Shut*](https://www.peliplat.com/en/library/movie/pp12649987/eyes-wide-shut), he tiptoed toward it. But in *Magnolia*? He dove headfirst into the abyss and didn’t look back.\n\n[Read more ](https://www.peliplat.com/en/article/10059332/we-need-magnolia-tom-cruise-back)",

    "title": "Movie Review - Fountain Of Youth",
    "selftext": "https://youtube.com/shorts/rqKnkbtwqmM?feature=shared\n\nFountain Of Youth - 4.5/10. I’m so sorry to say this, but this might go down as the most dull blockbuster of the summer. Its sad really. You have some top tier talent here (Krasinski, Portman, Gonzalez, Gleeson, and Ritchie as the director). The man who wrote “Zodiac” wrote this (I’m shocked). And in total, the overall idea is actually fun and would’ve easily made for a new instalment in the “National Treasure” series. But what we are left with in “Fountain Of Youth” is a film that is a dull, tired, and mediocre derivative of other superior films. Its shot on location (which is awesome), which helps give this film more credence to being a globe trotting adventure. But the problem is that the performances are surprisingly stale, the thrills have been done to death in other movies, the writing is boring, the direction is pedestrian, and the overall chase for the fountain of youth has been done already in better fashion (“Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade” anyone?). It leads to a movie that looks cool, but doesn’t feel cool. When you have noticeable talent like this, you would expect at least the film to be more enticing and watchable. But, we are left with performances that feel like they just want to have the scene finished altogether. Guy Ritchie’s films exude character and swagger, and I enjoy his films for the most part. But for the guy that made “The Man From U.N.C.L.E.” and “The Gentlemen” to also be the director of this, is outstanding in terms of not marrying the swagger with story well. Supremely dull movie, and one that will probably work for people that have never seen an Indiana Jones or National Treasure film.",

    "selftext": "My first film of 2025 Cannes Film Festival — and what a way to start. Urchin marks the directorial debut of Harris Dickinson, known to many for Babygirl, but for me, it all began with the incredibly grounded and heartfelt Scrapper back on 2023. To see his first feature-length directorial project premiere in Un Certain Regard is exciting and genuinely moving. A young actor stepping behind the camera and bringing a story like this to one of the most prestigious stages in cinema? No shit!\n\nUrchin dives into the lowest depths of society, focusing on those at the absolute bottom. The story follows Michael (played by Frank Dillane), a man living on the edge, scraping by in a world that’s brutal and utterly indifferent to him. After a tense incident, Michael ends up in prison. But upon release, he tries to rebuild his life — entering rehab programs, seeking out work, even attempting to reconnect with people. At first, it looks like a film about survival — but it’s also about the often self-destructive cycles that come with it.\n\nFull review: https://www.showbizbyps.com/movies/urchin ",

    "title": "Movie Review - Lilo & Stitch",
    "selftext": "https://youtube.com/shorts/RsjNPoQ6g9g?feature=shared\n\nLilo & Stitch - 7/10. I’ve never actually seen any of the “Lilo & Stitch” films till now. So, I only had a vague idea as to how those movies work and how the characters are. This live action remake sees “Marcel The Shell” director Dean Fleischer Camp taking the reigns and making this beloved cartoon come to life. Camp’s work on Marcel was excellent, mixing in the real world with the adorable shell character. So it seemed like an obvious choice to direct a live action film for Disney at one point. Ironically, when the original released, it wasn’t a run away blockbuster like other Disney films. It gained a ton of fandom over the years, with Stitch also becoming a beloved Disney character too. What works here is the wild antics of Stitch, the friendship created between Lilo and Stitch, and also, the overall message of family (regardless of how connected or dysfunctional they might be). But the problem is that, even with no prior context of this franchise, there seems to be a frenetic and chaotic energy present here. The story sort of runs at a breakneck pace from the first scene onwards. There are moments to breathe, and that is mainly residing in the emotion beatpoints of the story, but overall it was a little bit too fast at times. Stitch is an adorable and great character, and its those antics that will really make people love this movie. But outside of him, the emotional beats of this movie work, but those beats are surrounded by a film that feels a little soul less at times. Things are happening, jokes are trying to be made with other characters, but I just couldn’t get into the narrative as much as I wanted. The performances are nice and neat, and the music is nice, but I felt the visual aspect of the film felt a little flat. To be frank, this is probably the best live action remake Disney has made in recent years. But overall, Lilo & Stitch works wonders in bunches. Good family fun, though, its not perfect!",

    "title": "Highest 2 Lowest - dir. Spike Lee w/ Denzel Washington",
    "selftext": "Hey folks. I watched Highest 2 Lowest in the Cannes film festival. The movie is set to release late August on Apple TV+. \n\nHere is my review, which also can be read at: https://reviewsonreels.ca/2025/05/25/highest-2-lowest/\n\nSpike Lee has a knack for butchering the legacy of brilliant Asian films. After the disaster that was Oldboy, he’s back—this time turning a taut, thematically rich thriller into a loud, shallow, melodramatic mess. You’d think he could’ve learned something from the material. A story about humility ends up in the hands of a filmmaker more interested in surface-level thrills than the moral weight underneath.\n\nAkira Kurosawa’s High and Low (1963) is one of Letterboxd’s highest-rated films for a reason—a gripping drama that starts as a claustrophobic chamber piece and masterfully transitions into a morally complex, deeply tense thriller. Since it was based on Ed McBain’s American novel, set in a New York-like city, transplanting it to modern-day NYC—framed through the music industry and viewed through a racial lens—made a lot of sense. But the execution disrespects that premise, tossing out the original’s themes in favor of tonal chaos.\n\nThe plot stays intact: David King (Washington), a once-powerful music executive, must choose between saving his fortune or paying ransom for his chauffeur’s kidnapped son. William Alan Fox’s script includes a few clever updates—mainly around the police and family dynamics—but it never captures the original’s complexity. Where Kurosawa tied the story to ideas of honor, this version gestures at race and class but never truly explores what it means to “look down” when you’ve had to fight your way up. The tension is there on the page, but the film never brings it to life.\n\nIt’s all undone by execution that suggests Lee has simply lost his grip. The first half plays like a syrupy early-2000s melodrama—I kept thinking of The Family Man with Nicolas Cage—complete with an overabundant and insufferable score by Howard Drossin. There isn’t a single scene that isn’t ruined by overwrought piano and cymbal crashes. Pacing is another big issue: dialogue scenes drag, feel repetitive, and never build the inescapable tension the original thrived on. Tonally, it’s a mess. Jeffrey Wright plays it straight (and delivers the only grounded performance), while King’s family and colleagues feel plucked from a Hallmark movie. A$AP Rocky goes full camp. And Denzel tries a bit of everything, delivering one of the weakest performances of his career. He never sells the inner conflict, and when the script calls for a major emotional shift, it feels completely unearned. And yes—he raps.\n\nThings briefly improve when the thriller element kicks in—particularly during a train sequence at the Puerto Rican Day Parade. It’s flashy, confident, and technically slick… right up until a suitcase lands perfectly in the villain’s hands in a moment of hilarious unintentional comedy. What should be the character’s emotional turning point feels hollow and over-directed. Even the quieter moments that follow—like a potentially strong recording booth scene—can’t land, because the character’s decision never registers. And then we’re back to rap battles, music video detours, and clunky dialogue.\n\nBy the end, no one seems to know what kind of film they’re making. The original’s elegant tension between moral duty and personal ambition is gone. Highest 2 Lowest piles on mismatched tones, clashing performances, and a score that never stops getting in the way. Denzel looks lost. Spike Lee feels checked out—except when he isn’t, and instead pulls focus away from the story. And when we reach a four-minute song interlude before the credits (is the protagonist launching his own American Idol now? Is that the moral of the story?), it’s clear that the film that should’ve been about empathy, sacrifice, and class has been stripped of all humility and care. One of the most misguided remakes in recent memory. \n\nLowest of the Lowest.",

    "selftext": "https://youtube.com/shorts/XhA-7Re2XU4?feature=shared\n\nFear Street: Prom Queen - 5.5/10. I was a little excited for this, as I actually appreciated the trilogy of “Fear Street” films that came out in 2021. The weekly release strategy was so cool and interesting too. “Prom Queen” is the new instalment, not really having anything to do with the previous movies, and it comes as a whimper. The problem stems from the fact that this is a slasher idea that has been done to death (no pun intended). You have caricature characters, subpar acting, and a super predictable story. The gory kills and the second half is what saves this movie in a sort of way, but I wouldn’t say its on the level of the 1978 sequel from the original trilogy. To be honest, it feels like they just wanted to cash in on something that worked before, and slapping R.L. Stine’s name and series on the title is what makes this a little more enticing I guess. Either way, a just passable slasher!",

    "title": "Friendship (2025) review",
    "selftext": "Friendship (2025) Dir. Andrew DeYoung\n\nIt’s been a while since I laughed out loud while watching a film. Sometimes, this is because I struggle with pure comedy films—by that, I mean when it feels like comedy for comedy’s sake. I appreciate comedy more when it’s written into the characters from the start of the film, rather than when it comes from characters who feel like they’re doing stand-up. What I’m trying to say is, I prefer comedy that has a story behind it. That being said, Friendship does this brilliantly, in my opinion.\n\nI have to say, at the beginning of the film, I struggled a bit to get familiar with the comedy. This is normal, as certain types of comedy can be an acquired taste. It took me about ten minutes to acquire that taste, and honestly, it ended up working for me. It may not work for everyone though.\n\nThe characters are also quite relatable in a way that feels hilariously real. It’s as if the director or writer is telling an exaggerated story about something that happened to them or someone they know. I always admire it when directors can make the audience feel for characters who are actually really annoying. It’s usually because the character is the lead—we follow their story, see the film from their point of view, and understand why they are the way they are. I guess that’s why, in a film like Todd Phillips’ Joker, you sometimes find yourself supporting the Joker. It’s really all about perspective when you think about it.\n\nNot everyone deserves to be sympathized with—but wait, it may sound crazy to say, but even for the worst of the worst people on Earth, if you were shown a film from their perspective, you’d probably sympathize with some part of their story. I find that interesting to think about, and I’ve been thinking about it ever since I saw films like Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driverand Joker—two films that explore the idea of perspective.\n\nThe story and characters in this film are actually really sad and depressing. But there’s something about the comedy in this story that works so well given the circumstances.\n\nI enjoyed the editing and music placement—it really added to the comedic feel of the film. I feel like some comedic films forget that they’re films and just stack jokes on top of jokes, ignoring the fact that films are audiovisual. They often overlook visual storytelling in the editing, thinking it’s enough to just be funny. But the way a film is edited can elevate the jokes and sometimes even be funnier than the jokes themselves. More comedic film directors need to remember they’re making films, not skits.\n\nI’ll conclude by saying that although I enjoyed the film and had a good laugh watching it, I struggled a little bit with the drama aspect. A few characters felt a little too underdeveloped for my liking. It worked for the most part, but I was left wanting a bit more from that part of the story. ",

    "selftext": "Ryan Coogler, who directed “Sinners,” has had Michael B. Jordan as his star in his last four major films. So, it’s easier to make good movies when you are doing that. This one was no exception. Even though Jordan is the star/stars of this film, the breakout performance is by Caton, who plays Sammie Moore.\n\n“Sinners” was quite the ride from beginning to end. From the slow-burning start to the literal burning of a horde of vampires at the end. It was full of action, horror, a little romance, and some comedy. All this put together with some great acting and even better directing makes this a hit all around. I do feel like the ending was somewhat rushed after the slow start, but it was still fitting. Also, the after-credit scenes were extremely fun. All this added together, I give this a very strong 8 out of 10!

    "selftext": "[https://www.peliplat.com/en/article/10057847/nonnas-is-nostalgia-in-a-can](https://www.peliplat.com/en/article/10057847/nonnas-is-nostalgia-in-a-can)\n\nI got a call from my girlfriend. \"Did you see it?\" I immediately knew what she meant. It was April 9th, the day the trailer for *Nonnas* dropped.\n\n\n\nYou need to understand the hype. In my house, [movies about a group of old ladies going on an adventure are the epitome of cinema](https://www.peliplat.com/en/article/10038904/80-for-brady-or-the-guilt-i-feel-for-wasting-my-time). There was a time when I used to be embarrassed by it, but I've learned to embrace my love for these movies (maybe even films?).\n\n\n\nAnd the trailer? Amazing.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Four* older ladies*.* This is, by far, the optimal number of old ladies the subgenre demands. They each represent a different outlook on family, life, memory, death. Like a Cartesian plane where axes of \"zest for life\" and \"fond memories\" intersect, the four ladies configuration gives these films the best chance to explore every combination. And the math works, trust me!\n\n\n\nLike any great masterpiece, the trailer innovates. It tells us *Nonnas* is not only about the titular grandmas, it's about Vince Vaughn. A bold addition to the beloved family recipe that is this subgenre. Would it work, though? I'd have to wait.\n\n\n\nWith this, I hope you understand that Nonnas is my *Avengers*. Had it been released in theaters, I would've gone dressed like an Italian grandmother. So, I counted the days. I avoided early reviews, social media posts, my own grandmother, in case she would somehow spoil it for me.\n\n\n\nThe day finally came. May 9th. I turned off the lights, opened a bottle of wine, prepared a cheese platter, and got ready to shut off my brain and open my heart.\n\n\n\n# Ready-made nostalgia\n\nThe opening sequence of *Nonnas* is nostalgia in a can. A young boy during a big family get-together goes out to buy bread and comes back to his grandmother and mother cooking in the kitchen. We get a glimpse of the dishes they're making. I don't know any of them, but I'd try anything and ask for seconds. We see his family eating, drinking, celebrating, having a great time. You get the feeling of having been there once, maybe many years ago, but you remember.\n\n\n\nThis opening scene takes us back to that famous madeleine and tea passage in Proust's *Rememberance of Things Past.* In the novel, the narrator tries a madeleine soaked in tea, and suddenly long-forgotten childhood memories come rushing back to him (It's a lot nicer and deeper when Proust says it). There's something similar here, that involuntary memory that gets triggered by pictures of food that I've never even tasted. And you get that in two hours, not in a thousand pages like with Proust.\n\n\n\n*Nonnas* does all the heavy lifting so that those memories flow effortlessly. Yes, it's easy to see through it, it's not subtle and you know you're being manipulated, but these are the moments that work best in the film.\n\nAfter that, we jump into the present day. That young boy is now Joe (Vince Vaughn) at his mother's funeral. He's got a great support network, but it's pretty clear he's lost without her. There's a great scene after everyone leaves, he has tons of casseroles made for him, but he prefers to cook a meal for himself from scratch. The true meaning of comfort food. Yes, very sentimental, but that's the heart of this movie, the scene that drives it.\n\n\n\nThis scene also highlights another aspect: the voluntary memory. Unlike its counterpart, these recollections are consciously looked for. Joe *tries* to emulate his mother's cooking because he misses her, but he can't quite get there. It's a sterile way to remember, it's tied to what Joe feels and thinks in that moment, not to what can unexpectedly trigger a memory.\n\n\n\n*Nonnas* constantly plays with these ways of remembering, and ties them to grief. Involuntary memory, the one triggered by Proust's madeleine, is the one triggered by living, by experiencing new things and rediscovering lost memories. On the other hand, the voluntary memory, the one Joe tries to force out of his stale food, is the one that anchors you and doesn't let you move on.\n\n\n\n# You know what you're getting, and that's a good thing\n\n\n\nThere's no point spoiling the movie, you already know what's going to happen. It's predictable in the same way that eating your mother's cooking is predictable. It's familiar and inviting, and sometimes that's all you need.\n\n\n\nThey all look like your aunt. \n\nJoe has some money from his mother's life insurance, so he bets it all on family. Without giving it much thought, he opens a restaurant where old ladies do the cooking with their own family recipes. This lack of planning will keep coming back to bite him in the ass.\n\n\n\nBut even when things get rough, this is still a feel-good movie. Yes, Joe is losing all his money and might have to close the restaurant, but he created a community around him, he made his mother proud, he found love. What I'm trying to say is that, if you try watching this movie, they'll probably be bittersweet tears, never sad.\n\nAlso, like the Avengers, Joe must assemble a team. In this case, he puts an add on Craiglist (yes, a nonna makes the joke you're thinking about, \"Who's Craig?\"), and we get our four old ladies.\n\n\n\nIf you're a Marvel fan, you clap when Hulk smashes Loki. I clap when the four nonnas get drunk together and talk about the bittersweet curveballs life throws at them. They're grateful they met the love of their lives, and accept being alone after they're gone. Or maybe it's the opposite, they're grateful for never settling down, for being independent and living life their way. That's probably the best scene in *Nonnas*. Talia Shire, Susan Sarandon, Lorraine Bracco and Brenda Vaccaro being grateful for what they've had and what they've lost.\n\n\n\nAnd adding Vince Vaughn to the mix? Chef's kiss. He brings the right amount of charisma and vulnerability that these subgenre thrives on. You already know there's gonna be a scene where he uses his charm to try and convince someone, and that he's not gonna get it. And you already know it's gonna be great.\n\n\n\nThe film's not perfect. There were some parts where I thought the film was really pushing it with the Vince Vaughn missing his mom's angle. Like, it was borderline awkward and handled like he had a crush on her. It's hard to explain, but the editing every time they look at each other makes it seem like they're in love. It's a stretch to read that much into it, but it's definitely there.\n\n\n\nAlso, unlike other films in the genre, the zaniness is dialed down. For instance, at one point, the nonnas cause a fire in the restaurant after one of them tries to cook her famous capuzelle (apparently, a sheep's head filled with potato and other stuff). This leads to the firefighters showing up, and Joe getting a fine. However, if Jane Fonda and Lilly Tomlin had been in the kitchen, the whole place would've burned down and Jane would've ended hooking up with the captain. However, for neofites of the genre, this is probably the right choice.\n\n\n\n# Life after Nonnas\n\n\n\nThe end credits show little videos of the actual Joe, the restaurants, and the nonnas. The movie is, after all, based on a real story. They look like nice people, and the restaurant seems to be pretty good, but they're not the nonnas I fell in love with.\n\n\n\nWhat happens after *Nonnas*? Do I call my grandma? How could I call her after watching that? The one thing I clearly remember her cooking for me was a cold, hard piece of bread with butter and sugar. It's not like it happened once, that's her signature dish. But I thought of her, the movie unlocked that memory that was buried deep in me. Maybe I should call her, ask her for the recipe...\n\n\n\n*Nonnas* is not cerebral in any way, but it makes us nostalgic for something we never had, it makes us feel *something*, and not all movies do, not even Cinema with capital C.",

    "title": "Movie Review - Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning",
    "selftext": "https://youtu.be/G1rw-ccDaXs?feature=shared\n\nMission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning - 8.5/10. As a big fan of the series, this was slight disappointing. Maybe its on me for going into this film with sky high expectations, but “The Final Reckoning” is a tale of two halves. The first half is a little bit too explainy, and seems to be almost like a eulogy for the franchise. There’s tons of nostalgia and callbacks to literally all the films in the franchise (which is super surprising because usually a film franchise will ignore the “lesser” films). It also is setting up the stage for the fun and very Christopher McQuarrie second half, which boasts the big set pieces and has a lot going on in general. But in comparison to the other films that McQuarrie has done in Mission, this one definitely (and sadly) takes the cake for weakest in his run as the director. But for an 8th movie, this sure is pretty solid. To see Tom Cruise in his eight stand as Ethan Hunt is super cool, cause again, many spy films never have an opportunity to see a star go for this long as the main character. James Bond has had multiple iterations in a roulette fashion, Bourne had only 4 movies, and other spy films usually don’t last long. So for Cruise to keep upping the ante and making bigger stunts and spectacles to happen, good on him! The villain (who was definitely the weakest part of the previous film) is distractingly cartoonish here. I just can’t buy into his villainy. The rest of the cast is great here, and again, the set pieces are what takes the cake. The underwater sequence (such a cool use of expanding the ratio to IMAX) and the aerial dog fight was spectacular. Also, interesting how they utilized the butterfly affect here too. Also, I liked the idea that it was Ethan’s doing that caused the peril to begin with (very “The Dark Knight Rises”). But hey, if this is the end of the franchise, then its a bittersweet ending at that. Sure, it could’ve been a stronger end, but I had extremely high expectations to begin with. For what its worth, this is definitely one of the greatest 8th entries in a film franchise (might be the greatest if anything). It was like saying goodbye to an old friend. I will definitely miss Ethan Hunt and the Mission movies!",

Nevertheless this was a weak entry in this film series, mostly owning to a weak villain, some amorphous, disembodied concept of AI. It’s a cliché at this point but a great action movie of this nature needs a truly great villain. That’s why this film fails to deliver."

It just heavily talks about suicide. \n\nAs someone who has had an extremely traumatic life, this movie hit so fucking hard. It, not deeply, goes into why each character wants to end things as the movie goes on. It ends with them all breaking down and realising they wanted to save each other, which then turns into wanting to save themself. They dont go through with the suicide, and I think this was the creator of the assembly’s goal. \n\nIt hits so hard because this time last year, I was the lowest I could have been pushed to. Constantly battling to end my life. And then I met my now friends and partner. These people showed me a new way to live, and I’ve been slowly getting better. \n\nIn my opinion, the movie represents just that, but as a microcosm over a short span (like a night) but representative of how with the correct features of life, it can improve with time. I’m glad I stayed, I’m glad other suicidal people stayed. Cried like a baby at the end. \n\nI couldn’t find an english dub, it’s Japanese but I was fine watching english sub. If that doesn’t bother you, would absolutely recommend if this hits close to home. Made me even more confident about my decision to stay",

    "title": "Power Rangers (2017): A Decent Power Rangers Movie Held Back By Dated Humor (Spoilers)",
    "selftext": "After watching the 2017 Power Rangers movie, I can say it is a decent Power Rangers movie. It keeps the cheesiness and the cheap open sets like a quarry, the woods, or just a field as a battle ground. I thought the CGI looked pretty decent (except for the scene where they through a Camaro, that looked really bad). The suits were pretty cool in my opinion. I think if you like the Power Rangers, then you will have an enjoyable time. I'm not here to praise the film though. I had two big issues with the movie. The extremely cringy millenial humor and the characters Kimberly, Billy and Zack.\n\nHumor:\n\nThe humor in it is the same that you saw a lot in the 2010's and very early 2020's. The marvel humor as many call it. The amount of times that a character will say something and another character will say \"what?\" made me cringe so hard. The \"What?\" has never been a joke and never will be a joke. I wanted to rip my hair out at this one scene. **Spoiler:** The team is pinned against a fishing boat by Rita, she is interigating them for the location of the Zeo Crystal. Billy tells Rita after she chokes Zach a little. He says its at a Krispy Kreme. Zach then says \"Krispy Kreme?\" first off bad joke being in a Krispy Kreme, I know they probably paid to be in the movie but come on man, BOOOOO!!!! So after Rita leaves to go to search for the crystal, Billy drowns. Yata Yata Yata, Zordon brings Billy back to life. Then Billy says \"We need to go to Krispy Kreme!\" and Zach says \"What?\"..... AAGGGGHHHHHH, dude literally like 5 minutes ago you were told that the Zeo Crystal is at the donut shop. Not funny at all. It was the final \"What?\" joke that broke my sanity. \n\n There is a lot of this kind of humor the \"I'm doing a thing\" or \"Did that just happen\" humor. The amount of pop culture references too. If you have to reference pop culture to make a joke, then you can't write a joke in my opinion. This kind of humor really dates the movie. The Power Rangers is a classic series that can be enjoyed by many generations of viewers. But these jokes limit the humor to the millenial generation. Even then, I am a millineal and I don't find it funny at all. Gen Z finds it cringy, and so will the others after. Thats my biggest problem with the movie.\n\nKimberly, Billy, and Zach:\n\nI think the characters were alright, cookie cutter. You have the strong leader but dumb jock Jason. Billy the weird science kid.  Zack the clueless one. Kimberly the sympathetic one. And Trini the quite odd one. \n\nBilly I feel like they were trying to convey him as autistic, not just quirky. Which if they did, wow terrible job. He just does weird things and then has the fake OCD. Oh my pencils have to be aligned and perfect. Thats not what autism is, there needs to be order, but not like that. I just feel bad for the autistic community who has a character that is supposed to represent them but makes a mockery of them.\n\n**Spoiler:** Zach is such a terrible kid. His mom is bed ridden and he leaves every day to go to \"school\". He does not, he just goofs around. He says he doesnt want to be at home cuase he doesn't want to see his mom die, which I understand. I wouldn't want to see my mom die either, I love my mom. But dude your mom is bedridden in the middle of the woods in a mobile home. You are leaving her during the day and night. We see you go home give her some pills and giver her dinner before you leave again 10 minutes later. Your poor mom is in this small room, sitting in piss and shit, waiting for you to come home to clean her up. But you don't want see her die, but are compeletly fine leaving her in a vulnerable and filthy state. You are terrible son and not a strong character.\n\n**Spoiler:** Kimberly I think doesn't understand that she isn't the real bad guy in her own story. She sent a photo of her friend to a guy that she liked, but the guy liked Kimberly's friend. She sent the photo to her crush saying \"Is this the kind of girl you want to bring home to your parents.\" Now the photo gets a big reaciton. I'm assuming the photo is either sexual photo or a drunk photo. Either way it spreads through the school like wild fire. Her crush then says she is the meanest person in the world and she punches him in the face. Yes she did start the photo being shared around, but she only sent it to her crush. He sent it to others. Now everyone feels bad for him because he got sucker punched, but isn't he a bigger scum bag than Kimberly. He is the one that sent the photo around school. Also Kimberly is way to melodramatic and is a headache to symapthize for. She just is always poor me, I suck. It gets old very very quickly.\n\nOverall I think the movie is decent and can be a good time especially for Power Rangers fans. I just have my gripes with the movie. The humor and 3 of the 5 main characters are terrible written. None are great chracters but those 3 really pull the movie down. I give the movie a 5/10. I won't be watching it again, but I'm also not mad I watched it. ",

    "selftext": "*Drop* has a lot working in its favor. I enjoyed several of director Christopher Landon’s previous films, including *Happy Death Day*, *Freaky* and even *Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones*. (*Happy Death Day 2U* was redundant.) He’s working in Alfred Hitchcock mode here, capturing the action from every angle possible. The screenplay by Jillian Jacobs and Chris Roach is heavily influenced by Hitchcock plots as well. The cast features two handsome up-and-comers in Brandon Sklenar (*It Ends With Us*) and Meghann Fahy (*The White Lotus* season 2). Although the movie takes place primarily in one location, cinematographer Marc Spicer captures it beautifully. Despite all that, I didn’t enjoy *Drop* very much.\n\nMy issues were with the film’s pacing and focus. Unlike Hitchcock’s classic thrillers, which had an ebb and flow to them which included breaks in the suspense, this film’s pace never lets up. Some may appreciate *Drop* for keeping its petal to the metal almost from beginning to end, but I grew weary of the tone. In an attempt to distract from what is a very basic story and bland dialog, Landon films everything with a lot of energy. (Having the unknown assailant’s text messages overlaid on the background is a nice touch.) I can’t blame him, though, because every time the film suggests we’ll get to know these characters–bzzp!–another text message arrives. When the two principles eventually share their troubled pasts, it arrives much too late in the story to have an impact.\n\nBecause the movie is so hyper-focused on the machinations of the plot device, there’s no room for the characters to breathe. Instead, the story is one character responding to a barrage of angry text messages while the other looks concerned. Although the gimmick is fun at first, it’s overused. I kept wishing that the heroine would drop her phone in a glass of water or the toilet so that I could experience actual character interactions. Instead, the movie repeats the following pattern over and over: chat with goofy waiter, buzz of text message, furtive glance at phone, excuse me I have to go somewhere else, frantic text exchange, return to table, repeat.\n\nIt’s a shame that Sklenar and Fahy can’t give more nuanced performances in this movie. This is the second film I’ve seen Sklenar in, and he’s been too good for both of them. Although he has more to do here than *It Ends With Us*, his character is reduced to patiently waiting for his date to begin. Fahy is the kind of blond that would have paralyzed Hitchcock, but the movie keeps her distracted and harried. I kept waiting for the two to exhibit some chemistry, but it never happened. (To be fair, the film doesn’t give them the opportunity to do that.)\n\nAlthough it is repetitious, contrived and ultimately ridiculous, *Drop* held my interest until the end. It’s nowhere near as good as the thrillers it emulates. It’s a trashy potboiler heavy on style. **Mildly recommended**.\n\n[https://detroitcineaste.net/2025/05/20/drop-movie-and-analysis-meghann-fahy-brandon-sklenar/](https://detroitcineaste.net/2025/05/20/drop-movie-and-analysis-meghann-fahy-brandon-sklenar/)",

    "selftext": "O Agente Secreto marks Kleber Mendonça Filho’s third appearance in Cannes’ main competition—after Aquarius (2016) and Bacurau (2019), the latter of which earned the Jury Prize and cemented his place as one of Brazil’s most vital cinematic voices. But this time, expectations felt heavier. The film followed in the wake of I’m Still Here, a cultural phenomenon that not only won Brazil its first Oscar for Best International Feature but also earned nominations for Best Picture and Best Actress—after years of neglect, Brazilian cinema was, once again, claiming global attention.\n\nWith that momentum, O Agente Secreto seemed perfectly poised. It starred beloved Brazilian actor Wagner Moura, was set during the dictatorship era, and early buzz even teased intriguing body horror elements. Given Mendonça Filho’s track record of fusing genre with political insight, expectations were sky-high. But instead of something truly original and electrifying, the film delivers something far more elusive—sometimes frustratingly so. Long, slow, and unapologetically opaque, it often feels tailored to a very specific audience.\n\nWe follow Marcelo (Moura), a man returning to Recife after years in exile, hoping to reconnect with his son. But his homecoming is anything but peaceful—he arrives to the sight of a corpse at a gas station and quickly realizes he’s being followed. Soon, he’s slipping into a shadowy routine of pseudonyms, tailings, and covert meetings, as though the dictatorship has turned him into a character in a noir. The metaphor—of ordinary citizens surviving dictatorship by living like secret agents—is sharp and well observed. Mendonça Filho leans into the absurdities of political corruption, visualizing them through surreal imagery: sharks with severed human legs inside, and that same leg later walking on its own, kicking gay cruisers to illustrate the absurdity of a real news story. Grotesque, absurd, and undeniably memorable.\n\nRead my full review at https://reviewsonreels.ca/2025/05/21/the-secret-agent-o-agente-secreto/",

    "selftext": "What did you think of Nonnas after watching?\n\nI went into this movie with little expectation but left with a warm heart and feeling pleasantly 'full' much like I would had if I had just left dining at the movie's titular restaurant Enoteca Maria.\n\nThe movie's plot is simple: Joe Scaravella (played by Vince Vaughn) decides the best way to celebrate the memory of his mother after her passing is to open a restaurant in Staten Island in her name where the chefs will be comprised of nonnas (Italian for grandmothers). The thinking is the restaurant is not simply a place to eat but also a place to experience 'family'.\n\nIn typical Vince Vaughn fashion he decides to open this restaurant with no restaurant experience, little to no money and his family isn't even from Staten Island (he's from Brooklyn).\n\nThe restaurant as can you imagine was a 'disaster' from concept to opening day.\n\nWithout giving too much of the movie away here are my likes and dislikes of the movie:\n\nLikes:\n\n\\- The movie is simple and straight forward celebration of life and family leaving you warm and fuzzy inside after watching. Especially the love that Vince Vaughn's character has for his mother and nonna.\n\n\\- Although Vince Vaughn seems to 'play himself' in many of his movies I thought this was a movie role that was quite well suited for him even though it doesn't demand his typical comedic chops. The character is a bit naive/simple minded, likeable and full of love.\n\n\\- The dynamic between Vince Vaughn and Joe Manganiello (playing his best friend Bruno) I felt was one of the more interesting relationships in the movie. Particularly the scene where they need to express their feelings and apologise to each other. Seeing them struggle as 'manly American Italian men' with this task was quite humorous.\n\nDislikes:\n\n\\- The movie and plot progression is a little too 'predictable' but I didn't mind that. I find movies like this is like a wine that drinks easy. Yes, it's not the 'best' in terms of complexity but is still satisfying.\n\n\\- There was quite a lot left on the table in terms of character development particularly amongst the nonnas. There were some funny and warm moments between them but given I think they were actual the key characters of the movie in my opinion I felt this was a missed opportunity.\n\nBut overall if you are looking for an easy to enjoy and heart warming movie I suggest giving Nonnas a go.\n\nIt will make you think about your mother, nonna and family after.\n\nAs a guy I don't often cry in movies but I definitely shed a few tears towards the end.\n\nI give Nonnas a 7.5 out of 10.\n\nWhat did you think of his movie?",

    "selftext": "It all starts quietly—a couple moving into a house they’ve inherited after a relative’s suicide, brushing off dust and dancing like they’ve got all the time in the world. And for a moment, it feels like they do. But since this is a Lynne Ramsay film, that comfort doesn’t last. The event that shifts everything: the protagonist becomes a mother.\n\nFrom then on, the abundance of time turns cruel. Days stretch endlessly, silence becomes unbearable. Unlike last year’s Nightbitch, which treated motherhood as a disruption of peace, Die, My Love sees it as too much peace—until it curdles into boredom. The protagonist detaches—from her baby, her passions, and her husband, who seems to have lost all desire for her. It’s no longer a relationship, just proximity—she’s raising a child next to a man who’s become little more than background noise.\n\nRamsay does strong work placing us inside her head. She makes excellent use of sound design, turning the domestic space into something almost hostile—mosquito buzzes, car engines, and the baby’s cries become almost unbearable. We also feel the weight of repetition, the dull ache of waiting for something—anything—to shake her awake. Even a visit to her cruel mother-in-law feels like a break in the monotony. We’re completely on her side when it comes to her husband and his circle of quietly judgmental friends. We’re drawn so close to her unraveling that it’s hard not to root for it.\n\nRead my full review at https://reviewsonreels.ca/2025/05/20/die-my-love/",

    "selftext": "https://youtube.com/shorts/6Gqmqw4n1mI?feature=shared\n\nGangers - 6.5/10. It seems to me that one of my favourite sub genres in tamil cinema is the “school reform” genre. Movies like “Nammavar,” “Saatai,” “Petta (the first half)”, and “Master.” “Gangers” seems to be leaning in that direction for its first half at points. Mixed that with a typical revenge drama as well, the first half of Gangers is kinda just meh. The interviews and promos for the film promised a fun and jolly ride for the most part. That quotient of the actual film is fulfilled in the second half however. I wouldn’t say that second half is amazing, but it does do the trick for the most part. We see the story shift into a heist dramedy in the second half, and like Sundar C was saying in interviews, he wanted to do an “Oceans” or “Money Heist” type of heist in a small town. And to be honest, that part of the movie was actually interesting and well done. This is your typical Sundar C movie so don’t expect too much in terms of quality in story. Its designed more of a “checking the boxes” type of film. Vadivelu is here, and though this isn’t incredible comedy from the legend, you can tell its the second half of the movie which made him sign up for the project. Everything else in this film is just passable, and it did pass the time. I was surprised by the ending though. That twist kinda comes out of left field, and obviously its designed that if there were a sequel, we could get more context. But I appreciated that bit of creativity from Sundar C. But, Sundar C has done better in the past. For what its worth, a decent entertainer.",

That’s the central premise behind this slick but slight film, starring Jack Quaid in a rare leading role as the good guy, a refreshing pivot from his recent turns in [*Companion*](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/companion-2025/) and [*Scream 5*](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/scream-5-movie-2022/).\n\n[Quaid](https://cinephilecorner.com/cast-and-crew/jack-quaid/) plays Nate, an introverted bank assistant manager who lives a quiet life mostly confined to work, video games, and avoiding unnecessary risk. He has CIPA (congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis) a rare disorder that makes him unable to feel physical pain or temperature, leading to a lifetime of caution and solitude. Enter Amber Midthunder as Sherry, a co-worker who seems to genuinely connect with Nate, prompting him to step outside of his comfort zone for the first time in years.\n\nThat comfort is shattered when a bank robbery turns deadly. The manager is killed, Sherry is kidnapped, and the police are left clueless. Nate takes it upon himself to track down the robbers and save her, using his unique condition as his only real edge in a world that otherwise completely outmatches him.\n\n[Movies Like 'Novocaine'](https://cinephilecorner.com/lists/movies-like-novocaine/)",

    "selftext": "[Full 'Final Destination' Movie Review](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/final-destination-movie-review-2000/)\n\n*Final Destination*, directed by James Wong and written by Wong and Glen Morgan, is a horror film with a concept so enduring it’s become part of pop culture shorthand. The idea—that death itself has a design and you can’t truly escape it—has fueled an entire franchise, but the original remains a fascinatingly restrained starting point for a series that would later become known for its wild, Rube Goldberg-style death sequences.\n\nIn *Final Destination*, we follow high schooler Alex Browning (played by [Devon Sawa](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/heart-eyes-movie-review-2025/)), who, while boarding Flight 180 to Paris with his classmates, experiences a vivid premonition of the plane exploding mid-air. His panic causes a scene, and he and several others are removed from the flight. Moments later, his vision proves horrifyingly accurate—the plane crashes, killing everyone who remained onboard. Alex and his fellow survivors—Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), Carter Horton (Kerr Smith), and others—find themselves grappling with the unthinkable: they’ve somehow cheated death.\n\nBut as the survivors begin dying in bizarre and gruesome ways, it becomes clear that they weren’t meant to live. Death, as explained by the ominous mortician William Bludworth (Tony Todd), has a plan, and it’s coming back for each of them. What follows is a slow-burn thriller filled with mounting dread, as seemingly innocuous details—a leaky pipe, a loose wire, a train crossing—become harbingers of elaborate doom.\n\n[Movies Like 'Final Destination'](https://cinephilecorner.com/lists/movies-like-final-destination/)",

    "selftext": "[Full 'Mission: Impossible - Fallout' Movie Review](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/mission-impossible-fallout-movie-review-2018/)\n\n*Mission: Impossible – Fallout*, directed by Christopher McQuarrie and [starring Tom Cruise](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/top-gun-maverick-2022/), isn’t just the high point of its own franchise—it’s a modern action masterpiece, arguably one of the greatest action films ever made. As the sixth installment in the [*Mission: Impossible*](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/mission-impossible-1996-movie-review/) series, *Fallout* takes everything that made the previous films thrilling and dials it up to a level that almost feels physically exhausting—in the best possible way.\n\nBy [2018](https://cinephilecorner.com/lists/best-movies-2018-ranked/), audiences had already seen Ethan Hunt [scale the Burj Khalifa](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/mission-impossible-ghost-protocol-movie-review-2011/), [dangle from airplanes](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/mission-impossible-rogue-nation-movie-review-2015/), and [infiltrate high-security government facilities](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/mission-impossible-1996-movie-review/), but *Fallout* still manages to surprise with jaw-dropping stunts and real-world spectacle that few blockbusters even dare to attempt. Cruise, now deep into his 50s during filming, throws himself into every sequence with the kind of relentless intensity that has come to define his late-career resurgence. Whether it’s the HALO jump from 25,000 feet, a roaring motorcycle chase through Paris, or a helicopter pursuit through jagged mountain terrain, *Fallout* pushes the boundaries of what real, practical stunt work can look like in the modern cinematic landscape.\n\nThe plot, continuing directly from [*Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation*](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/mission-impossible-rogue-nation-movie-review-2015/), is more than just connective tissue for these stunts. Sean Harris returns as Solomon Lane, the villain whose ideology and presence still haunt Ethan. Lane’s old organization, The Syndicate, has rebranded as The Apostles, a terrorist collective plotting to use three plutonium cores to destabilize global order. The IMF team—Benji (Simon Pegg), Luther ([Ving Rhames](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/the-instigators-movie-2024/)), and Ilsa ([Rebecca Ferguson](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/dune-part-two-movie-2024/))—are once again pulled into an international mission with the highest of stakes. But this time, they’re joined by CIA operative August Walker, played with brutish swagger by [Henry Cavill](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/argylle-movie-2024/), whose infamous bathroom fight scene with Cruise is one of the film’s many highlights.",

We also had “Veera Dheera Sooran” this year, and now we have “Ten Hours.” To be honest, even with the differences in plot and execution, I couldn’t help but think of the strong inclination that this is strongly inspired by Kaithi. The religious protagonist who seeks justice, the night setting, a police station being one of the major settings, multiple characters, and a bus being a major device in the plot. This was actually decent overall, with a pretty good mystery to it and with nice and neat direction. Sibiraj slowly is building a good filmography, with a variety of different stories. In terms of his cop films, I still feel like “Kabadadari” is his best work, but this is not too shabby too! A decent thriller, though it feels too familiar!",

    "title": "Urchin (Cannes 2025 Review) dir Harris Dickinson",
    "selftext": "As I mentioned in my review of The Chronology of Water, when comparing the three directorial debuts by Hollywood actors in this year’s Cannes lineup, I initially felt Kristen Stewart’s film seemed the most fitting for the festival. I haven’t seen Scarlett Johansson’s Eleanor the Great yet, but with Urchin, I stand corrected. Harris Dickinson’s debut feels far more like something that would premiere at TIFF: a compelling but ultimately familiar portrait of a homeless man caught in a cycle of self-destruction and self-sabotage. It’s full of good intentions, but often feels a bit out of its depth and occasionally artificial. A predictable exploration of how society shuts its doors on those who’ve fallen too far—without offering them a real way back.\n\nThe film works best when introducing its main character, Mike, played with real vulnerability and a kind of childlike longing by Frank Dillane. I especially liked how the film holds back on revealing the character’s deeper impulses, letting them unfold gradually and culminating in a brief flashback that reframes an earlier scene, offering a different perspective on everything we’ve seen so far. As Mike is released from prison, you can sense his effort—he wants to do better—but lacks the tools. And even when support systems appear (a hostel, a job, the beginnings of new relationships), they always feel temporary, conditional. You can almost hear the ticking clock. From there, the story hits all the expected beats. Dickinson does what he can to elevate the material, but there’s only so much to be done with a script that feels so mapped out.\n\nTo his credit, the direction is Urchin’s strongest asset—alongside Dillane’s remarkable performance. Dickinson shows promise behind the camera, using the score effectively and resisting the pull of cheap sentimentality. He often chooses to observe rather than dictate, letting scenes breathe, and that restraint gives the film moments of quiet weight. It’s a confident first outing. That said, his decision to cast himself in a supporting role feels unnecessary and distracting.\n\n\nRead my full review at https://reviewsonreels.ca/2025/05/19/urchin/",

With a playtime of close to 3 hours, this is no small budget short film! You get to see Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt in all his glory, taking on Big Bads to save the world as we know it!\n\n# The Plot of Mission: Impossible - Final Reckoning\n\nPicking up from where [**Dead Reckoning**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/mission-impossible-dead-reckoning) left off, The Entity, a vastly powerful self-aware AI, is out to \"conquer\" the world through digital means, and Ethan Hunt is the only one who can stop the AI from doing that. Personally, as a professional, I think the scariest aspect of the whole movie is The Entity trying to eliminate Hunt's job somehow. But this is fiction, therefore, it is trying to kill everyone instead of just replacing them at their jobs. - making it the right kind of scary and entertaining.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ychgh64moq1f1.png?width=878&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c9e4dee176ef83f63a0fc514ac18d0363023383\n\nEthan uses something called a cruciform key to retrieve what is the source code on a device called the Podkova in a submarine that sank in the last movie in the Arctic.\n\nYes, there are way too many moments where people in Ethan's world put their absolute trust in his mission to save the world, a lot of last glances, heavy dialogue, and so many one-liners ( some of which are actually good ). I don't mean to nitpick, but it does get a bit repetitive, but it IS Tom Cruise who does his own stunts, and this movie is definitely a labor of love.\n\nThere will be a point for even hardcore fans of the Mission: Impossible Franchise where you will cringe at the back and forth between Hunt and the villains. I AM a big fan of Tom Cruise AND this franchise, and I did cringe a few times at similar lines throughout the movie.\n\n***Check out*** [***Hit Man Netflix Movie Review***](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/hit-man-netflix-movie-review-glen-powell)\n\nMost of the comedy arising out of high-tension situations is fine, but some of them seem to be shoe-horned in, such as one particularly bad exchange between Hunt and Gabriel, played by Esai Morales.\n\n# Requires at Least Two Watches\n\nFinal Reckoning is basically [**The Avengers: Endgame**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/2019/05/21/avengers-endgame-movie-review) of the Mission: Impossible Franchise and is dense with plot points, callbacks, and deep cuts - none of which is gratuitous. This means you will need to watch this movie at least twice, in the theaters, to fairly assess the quality and scope of such a movie.\n\n***Read*** [***The Fall Guy Movie: A Fun Action Flick***](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/the-fall-guy-movie-fun-action-flick)\n\nComing to the plot twists, I didn't see most of them coming, maybe because I am invested in the eight-movie-long arc, and don't want to spoil it for myself or others.\n\n# The Cast\n\nThe success of the Mission: Impossible Franchise is in part due to its consistent core cast that has remained unchanged since the very first movie in 1996. Ethan, Benji, Luther, and even Kitteridge ( Henry Czerny ) from time to time.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zx0bim2roq1f1.png?width=907&format=png&auto=webp&s=857550e4c2993a09f01324272038b7f9ccd2db9d\n\nThe final instalment of this Franchise includes Angela Bassett, who now plays the POTUS, Nick Offerman as a high-ranking general, and Hannah Waddingham as the Commander of a US Battleship. There is also Pom Klementieff as Paris, the reformed [**assassin**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/amazon-prime-mr-and-mrs-smith) who, when asked about medical experience, says, \" I Only Kill People!\"\n\nA delightful addition to the cast is the rising star of Tramell Tillman, playing the captain of a clandestine US Submarine. You might recognize him from his awesome performance in [**Severance**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/severance-apple-tv-series-work-life-balance-taken-to-a-whole-new-level) as the struggling floor manager.\n\n# Tom Cruise - The Enigma\n\nI was never a big fan of Tom Cruise until I realized he really IS Ethan Hunt in real life - every single stunt, especially in this franchise, is done by him and only him. He is one of those people who needs to walk the razor's edge to feel alive, a lot like Vin Diesel's character in The Fast and the Furious franchise ( only a lot more relatable )\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xrk8nnpvoq1f1.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=d35cef03772ef3f1a97c52251c4f991a83c7cb90\n\nEvery single movie project he gets into might end badly, but he does it anyway. Personally I think that's crazy, but also in a way he's being his most authentic self - how many of us really live the life we want? I'm not talking about timely adventurous vacations, but things that truly challenge you?\n\n>[I actually said I’m going to make movies into my 80s; actually, I’m going to make them into my 100s. - Tom Cruise](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/tom-cruise-making-movies-into-100s-mission-impossible-1236220928/)\n\nI'm sure Tom Cruise plans to live and even die while acting out one of his elaborate stunts, which is kinda cool tbh, but also just a little insane, in a great way.\n\n***Check out*** [***Syfy Series Resident Alien: Alan Tudyk's Comedic Magnum***](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/syfy-series-resident-alien-review)[ ***Opus***](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/syfy-series-resident-alien-review)\n\nAt this point in his life and probably in the foreseeable future, Cruise is not acting for the money; it's mostly for the thrill of being an action star and being the best at what he does.\n\n# Cinematography and Practical Effects\n\nOne of the selling points of this movie and the franchise in general is the amazing cinematography of sprawling landscapes in the most beautiful, dangerous, and even remote locales for shooting. One of my favorite scenes is seeing Cruise's Ethan Hunt curling into a foetal position in the icy cold arctic waters of the North.\n\nThe Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS) station is also quite breathtaking, given that the environment is pristine and yet highly dangerous for anyone not familiar with the terrain and temperature.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ow4cpvkyoq1f1.png?width=877&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b3f8d38908d1f913904be8a6bbf71e593674785\n\nAnother key point in the movie is when Ethan Hunt climbs into a pod to access and interface directly with The Entity, which is shown well and reminds me of Neo hooking himself up to the core AI in The Matrix franchise.\n\nThe sequence where Tom Cruise enters the submarine that sank in the last movie is also shown really well, with details that are best watched on screen than described in a movie review!\n\nAll I'll say is that the submarine stunt is very well done and executed realistically ( as much as possible anyway )\n\n# New Technology\n\nOne of the things I like most about this franchise is that you get a sneak peek into cool cutting-edge tech that either is being developed or actually exists. One such moment was when they revealed the [**5D Memory Crystal**](https://www.5dmemorycrystal.com/technology/)**,** which is the size of an average pen drive but can store up to 360 TB of data.\n\n***You might like*** [***Deadpool & Wolverine: Strap in For A Fun Ride***](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/deadpool-wolverine-a-fun-ride)\n\nIf you're wondering how we have found access to another two dimensions that we cannot perceive, it is through the help of a process called birefringence or double refraction.\n\n# Should You Watch It? Hell Yes!\n\nWhile watching this movie is a no-brainer, you will enjoy it most if you watch all seven films before starting on the grand finale of the franchise.\n\n***Like this review?*** [**Subscribe**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/contact) ***to*** [**themoviejunkie.com**](http://themoviejunkie.com/)***!***",

    "selftext": "As far as movies about the making of a movie go, Linklater’s Nouvelle Vague is one of the better ones. It thankfully avoids the genre’s usual traps, never taking itself too seriously—as if the film being made (Breathless, from 1960) were some sacred monument in human history that must be treated with utmost reverence (cough Mank cough), nor painting its director as an ultra-complex, godsent artist destined for worship. Instead, Linklater approaches it like a small, self-aware project designed to entertain its core audience: cinephiles. The tone is light, the jokes are niche, and the structure feels closer to an MCU-style, cameo-driven, fan-pleasing romp—only this time, with Truffaut, Chabrol, Varda, and Rohmer as the superheroes.\n\nDirected by Linklater as yet another one of his stylistic detours (he always keeps things interesting, branching out into new styles every few years—but always reliably so), the film plays more like an extended SNL sketch. It’s the kind of comedy that only really lands if you already know who these French New Wave icons are. If not, some of the punchlines will likely pass you by.\n\nThat said, the film doesn’t completely limit itself to hardcore film nerds. The behind-the-scenes story is told with such a breezy tone and enough solid jokes that it stays accessible, and the built-in ticking clock—the 20 days they have to complete the shoot—adds just enough narrative momentum to engage even those unfamiliar with Breathless or the New Wave.\n\nRead my full review at https://reviewsonreels.ca/2025/05/19/nouvelle-vague/\n\n",

    "title": "Eddington (Cannes 2025 Review) w/ Joaquin Phoenix and Pedro Pascal",
    "selftext": "After the back-to-back success of Hereditary and Midsommar, Ari Aster was quickly crowned the next big voice in horror. But like Nicolas Winding Refn (Drive) and David Robert Mitchell (It Follows), the praise might’ve come a little too soon—and gone straight to his head. No matter how you felt about Beau Is Afraid, Eddington is where the cracks become undeniable. Aster’s reach now clearly exceeds his grasp, letting ambition steer the ship straight into incoherence. The film is packed with ideas, but without the clarity or control to make any of them land—resulting in self-indulgence and, ultimately, something deeply unappealing.\n\nIf Beau at least offered a strong first act before spiraling out, Eddington stumbles right from the start. It never settles into a rhythm. The tone constantly shifts, and storylines come and go without leaving a mark. By the time the film reaches its epilogue, it’s scrambling to tie together a mess that never had structure to begin with.\n\nSet during the early days of the pandemic, Eddington wants to satirize how people responded. But despite its prestige packaging—145 minutes, a stacked cast—it doesn’t say much more than The Bubble, Judd Apatow’s much-criticized pandemic comedy, also starring Pedro Pascal. The difference is that Aster truly believes he’s being deep.\n\nRead my full review at https://reviewsonreels.ca/2025/05/18/eddington/",

    "title": "The Chronology of Water - Kristen Stewart’s directorial debut (Cannes 2025)",
    "selftext": "One of the things that stood out in this year’s Cannes lineup was the number of actor-directed films—a trend more common at TIFF and other star-driven festivals than at Cannes. Between Scarlett Johansson’s Sundance-style drama, Harry Dickerson’s debut, and Kristen Stewart’s long-anticipated first feature, it felt like a wave of performers stepping behind the camera. Stewart was the one I was most curious about—not just because of the directors she’s worked with, but because her personality always comes across as sharp, opinionated, and unafraid to speak her mind. All signs of a potentially strong filmmaker. Still, I had doubts. I worried the film might lean too indulgent—and at times, it does. The sheer amount of style and ideas can get in the way of the story she’s trying to tell.\n\nStewart spent years reshaping her public image after Twilight, building trust by working with directors like Olivier Assayas and Pablo Larraín. Through interviews, she’s always seemed thoughtful, intense, and completely unfiltered. At Cannes, her intro speech made it clear she wasn’t there to play it safe. She seemed focused and passionate—even if that control sometimes clashes with the material. After touching words for her crew and sharp commentary about the festival, she ended with: “Let’s rip the f*cking Band-Aid off and watch the f*cking movie.” Raw, awkward, and genuine—just like the film that followed.\n\nThat same energy runs through The Chronology of Water. It’s complex, abstract, and clearly very personal. Stewart and Poots don’t ask us to root for the main character—or even like her. Instead, we watch someone unravel and slowly try to rebuild. Lidia isn’t a “heroine” in the usual sense. She spirals, self-destructs, pushes people away, and makes hard-to-watch choices. But there’s honesty in how it’s shown—especially in how early trauma shaped not just her behavior, but her identity.\n\n**Read my full review at: https://reviewsonreels.ca/2025/05/18/the-chronology-of-water/**",

      "1 = Sammie did not know that his music had supernatural levels of excellence, and I doubt that he ever learned that particular fact. He likely just lived his life as best he was able, never encountering a vampire until Stacks and Mary met him at that nightclub. \n\nThe music doesn't help or harm the vampires. His music can attract the attention of spirits and demonic forces. That doesn't happen every time he plays. It only occurs when he is at his peak. When he's kicked things up to 11 as it were. (Hopefully, you'll know that reference.) Just because his peak level can attract evil spirits, that doesn't necessarily mean evil spirits will come. Remmick just happened to be in the area to hear the performance. Sinners establishes that vampires can live forever, but it doesn't establish how many exist in the world. Thousands? Hundreds? Dozens? By the time of that mid-credit scene, Stack and Mary could be the only vampires in the United States for all we know. \n\nSammie said that BEFORE the vampire attack, that night in the juke joint was the best night of his life. Think about it. That was the first time he played in font of a big crowd. That was probably the first time he performed at peak 11. He didn't have to worry about his overbearing father. He probably had a few drinks of real alcohol because that was also the era of prohibition. He had sex with a married woman, which included trying out the ice cream licking technique. Of course, it was the best night of his life.... until the vampires.\n\n2) I have no idea why vampires need permission to enter a domicile. That has been a part of vampire myths for as long as I've been alive, and I'm two months away from being 50. The invitation rule isn't in all vampire media, but it has been used very often. The Lost Boys. Buffy The Vampire Slayer / Angel. Reinfield. \n\n3) Smoke was killed by bullets. Lots of bullets. Big gun fight. Many bullets. No one left standing... because of the bullets. \n\nI doubt that final moment with Smoke, Wunmi, and their child was Heaven as we traditionally think of it. Wunmi practiced hoodoo. The three of them were also wearing white garments, similar to white garments for the funeral of T'challa in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. Therefore, the Sinner's scene was probably inspired by African and Caribbean mythologies about the afterlife. Not a specific version of the afterlife. \n\n4) I don't remember that particular conversation. I would guess that they didn't know if Sammie would be able to get away with performing more than once because of his disapproving religious father. They just needed opening night to be spectacular. \n\n5) There is a voiceover at the start of the movie AND during Sammie's performance that clearly stated some people have the ability to connect to the spirit realm through their supreme talents. Yes, those spirits from the past and future were there while Sammie performed. No, the people didn't see them. Remmick and his vampires saw them though. \n\n6) I will share my thoughts in a follow-up replay in a few hours from now. Maybe after you've read my other answers, you'll have connected more of the dots.",
      "Hello again. I am following up on Number 6.\n\nIf I had to summarize all of this, then I guess the plot comes down to a simple question: How much of oneself should be sacrificed in order to be truly free?\n\nI see the plot as the collision of two extreme themes. For Smoke, Stack, and the Black people, they have lived under subjugation and injustice for so long that have to commit several crimes and vices in order to experience the feeling of freedom. The twins tried to better their lives by joining the Army and by working for Al Capone in Chicago. However, the twins found discrimination wherever they went. Therefore, the Twin decide to become their own bosses. If all they know is crime, hatred, and tragedy, then might as well make the most of a bad situation. They want to be upstanding pillars of the community, but Jim Crow and the Klan say otherwise. The same thing goes for the Black and Asian folks. If life only gives them wooden nickels, then grab your sinful pleasures where and when you can. \n\nFor the vampires, they believe in companionship and appreciation without bigotry or classism BUT a person has to become a monster and surrender his soul to achieve equality. When a person becomes a vampire, he gains the memories of other vampires and his experiences get shared with them. They are similar to The Borg from Star Trek. The vampires and the Borg seek peace though complete assimilation. No war. No crime. No conflicts. No rich. No poor. No Blacks, Whites, Japanese, Italian, Irish, etc. Instead, it is absolute inclusiveness from absolute submission. \n\nIn between those extremes is music. Music is among the few truly universal practices of humanity. Throughout human history, music has be used for rituals, communication, and creative expression. Every culture on Earth has music in one format or another, Music is like a universal language. As one of the twin's mentioned, White people love Blues music but hate the people playing it.\n\nFor the Black people, their music is an expression of freedom by defiance. \n\nFor the vampires, their music is an expression of freedom by homogeny.",
      "Hello one more time. \n\nI saw Sinners again today. I can better answer some of your questions.\n\n1A) Remmick wanted Sammie most because he hoped his music would allow him to see his ancestors. During the movie, he said that he'd not seen his people in a long time, and they had been trapped away. Remmick saw all those other musical spirits during Sammie's performance. I'm still not sure if \"his people\" meant the spirits of his human ancestors or demonic ancestors. One way or another, Remmick hoped Sammie's gifts would elevate the vampires' connection to the spirit realm. \n\n3A) Smoke died by a single bullet to the abdomen during the Klan attack. I thought with so much gun play in that scene, he would have been hit several times. Nope. Only one bullet managed to strike Smoke during that battle. \n\n4A) Smoke told Sammie that playing for the juke joint would only be \"one night,\" However, Smoke still wanted Sammie to play music. Smoke wanted Sammie to play church music or move to the Black-owned city and play music in a high class establishment. Smoke didn't want Sammie to fall into a world if crime and vice, like he and Stack did.",

    "selftext": "[Lots of improvements in his film work. But he's not there yet. ](https://preview.redd.it/v1zfimu8fe1f1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f725475598175a041c553f40d02d5be1c6b4dc2)\n\nI tried REALLY hard to enjoy it. And I did.\n\nRiiiiight up until the final quarter of the movie, that is.\n\nThe whole plot up to that point was very cryptic and felt like Abel was actually showing his demons to the world for once, He clearly does actually have a drug problem, as he's referenced multiple times that he's an addict of various different substances - including, but not limited to, cocaine and lean - so this movie shows that and relationship issues to tie it together (though honestly it might just be that way in real life; we don't actually know, because he's always kept most of his personal life private). That's well done, and I know Abel had a very big hand in the creative process so he actually DOES know how to make a coherent plot.\n\nThough I guess I'm the only one on the hill of \"The Idol wasn't actually THAT BAD\", but maybe I shouldn't say that too loud.\n\nAbel has very clearly brushed up on his acting skills, though he's not quite there at \"Blockbuster\" yet. He's a LOT BETTER, though, bar none. It's one thing to portray a fictional character, it's another thing to portray a fictionalized version of yourself saying and doing things you wouldn't normally say or do. He didn't do great as Tedros...actually, that was hands down the worst part of The Idol, so it's great to see him take such a huge step up. Unfortunately, the scale that his acting improved in comparison to the scale the projects jumped up in size aren't proportionate, but there is an improvement. However, he needs to project more, if you ask me. Lee's voice (Barry Keoghan) was very significantly overpowering him - maybe it was the sound system at Alamo Drafthouse, but this is what I experienced. Beyond that, he's much better than he was a few years ago.\n\nJenna Ortega did fantastic as Anima, though she did come off as a little dorky in the final quarter - more on that in a minute. Generally, though, she got it down pretty good. Barry Keoghan as Lee was a good casting choice, too.\n\nThe issues start when all of them meet.\n\nWithout spoiling the movie, it's literally Stephen King's \"Misery\". You can draw your own conclusion from there and imagine the ending. It's basically the same premise towards the end of the movie, almost note for note. There's some more exposition behind two of Abel's songs through the movie, and of course the production team is taking advantage of the tie-in album, but it's still just \"Misery\". And that's the issue: how do you deviate from \"Misery\" when your main character is literally The Weeknd?\n\nAnd just like the album and \"Misery\", it ends the same way it begins, with a subtle change. AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM.\n\nThis is a near-perfect remake of Stephen King's \"Misery\". Bar none. And while that's not a bad thing, if you're going to remake a movie or adapt a book, you need to translate it right and keep everything well-paced and uhh...not leave the audience feeling so unfulfilled?\n\nI've spoken highly of this film so far, and I admittedly do like the movie, but I have to give it a 2.5/5 because it was just a badly done remake. He had something going in the first 75%, but it literally all fell apart the second all of it started lining up with \"Misery\". And yes, I'm mentioning it a lot because it's exactly the same the closer to the end you get.\n\nI think the best way to put it is:\n\nIt's a spectacular, visually appealing, very well-made dud.\n\nIt has a great soundtrack. The cast did great. The writing is very good. There's a lot of genuinely memorable moments in the movie. The mood is fantastic.\n\nBut a dud is a dud. And this one REALLY failed to explode on impact.",

    "title": "The Plague (Cannes 2025) - dir. Charlie Polinger - fantastic portrayal of bullying",
    "selftext": "In my pre-teen years, I caught the plague—and judging by how painfully authentic his debut feature *The Plague* feels, so did first-time director Charlie Polinger. Not a literal illness, but something quieter and more insidious. It spreads through whispers, side glances, and silence. It feels like being marked, excluded, made untouchable. Polinger captures that experience with striking clarity, stripping away the usual nostalgia and warmth that often define coming-of-age stories and replacing them with something far more honest: terror. The terror of being left out. Of being mocked. Ridiculed in public. That awful, sinking feeling when the few people you’ve trusted suddenly turn their backs on you.\n\nThat’s eventually what happens to 12-year-old Ben (Everett Blunck), a new kid sent to a summer water polo camp in 2003. He’s not an outcast at first—smart, socially aware, trying to fit in—but also not quite popular. He can’t pronounce the final “t” in “Boston,” which makes him an easy target. Still, it’s nothing compared to Eli (Kenny Rasmussen), a quiet, isolated boy with a skin condition the others cruelly nickname “the plague.” When Ben begins to show empathy toward Eli, he starts slipping down the social ladder—forced to choose between going along with the cruelty or becoming its next victim.\n\nPolinger directs it all with surreal intensity and a sharp eye for mood and detail. The camera lingers just long enough on moments of casual cruelty, letting us feel the complicity of those who stand by. Some underwater scenes are stunning and otherworldly. There are flashes of horror, too—brief, jarring sights of blood or injury that hit like panic attacks. It’s all heightened by Johan Lenox’s haunting, glitchy score, which scrapes at the nerves and mirrors the confusion and dread building inside Ben. The tone may feel strange at first, but it perfectly matches that time in life when everything starts to matter and nothing feels safe.\n\n**Read my full review at https://reviewsonreels.ca/2025/05/17/the-plague/**\n\n**My Favorite Scene:** Jake’s surprisingly genuine apology to Ben.",

    "selftext": "A van cutting through the endless Moroccan desert. A father and son on a desperate quest. A group of nomads dancing through the night, chasing something just beyond the horizon. It sounds like the setup for a sweeping adventure film. Sirât is that—and more. What Laxe offers is an emotional journey where the impossible destination is a sense of wholeness that may no longer exist. Beneath the surface, it’s a quiet, aching search for meaning—for a daughter, for faith, for connection in a fractured world. An odyssey of grief and spiritual reckoning, where every mile feels like an attempt to stitch something broken back together.\n\nThe film often veers into the bizarre—at times even surreal—constantly evoking Mad Max through its imagery of battered vehicles tearing across sand dunes, a pulsing techno soundtrack, and the worn, almost otherworldly look of its characters. But where that franchise dives into chaos, Sirât moves toward something much more tender. Beneath the dust and beats, there’s a striking sense of empathy—an unexpected emotional current that slowly builds between strangers. These people are all running from something, or maybe toward something, and what binds them isn’t ideology or history, but suffering. That shared pain becomes the foundation for something that resembles family. A bond born not out of circumstance, but understanding.\n\nWe don’t get much background on the group. In fact, we barely get any. But it’s clear they’ve lost a lot. There are no tidy monologues explaining what happened or who they used to be. And that works. Because in Sirât, it’s not the past that matters—it’s the act of moving forward. Even questions like how the father can afford to drive off in search of his daughter feel irrelevant.\n\nRead my full review at reviewsonreels.ca/2025/05/16/sirat/\n\nMy Favorite Scene: A devastating handbrake accident—sudden, tragic, and a turning point for everything that follows.",

Her latest case involves a young man who was shot in the head with a flash-ball projectile—something officers are explicitly forbidden from doing. As she digs deeper, she uncovers disturbing evidence pointing to a clear abuse of power.\n\nThe film aims to expose the systemic rot within law enforcement, where officers protect each other and misconduct is quietly buried. It positions itself as an enraging commentary on institutional cover-ups and lack of accountability. But while the themes are undeniably relevant, the execution isn’t as impactful or searing as 2019’s Les Misérables. The film leans heavily on a clear-cut narrative: some officers committed wrongdoing, and the system closed ranks to protect them. There’s little ambiguity, no moral complexity, and not much to reflect on beyond the surface.\n\nRead my full review at https://reviewsonreels.ca/2025/05/16/case-137/",

    "selftext": "https://youtu.be/Gf-YmROjJFY?feature=shared\n\nHurry Up Tomorrow - 6/10. Probably will be the most divisive film of 2025. A smack dab in the middle vanity project for The Weeknd. Shall we also say its The Weeknd’s “Misery?” In a sort of way, “Hurry Up Tomorrow” works as fan service for The Weeknd’s die hard fans. It will speak to them, for whomever has been there since the Balloon era till now. But for casual listeners and people that just know by chance that The Weeknd is a musician, this will be an extremely hard watch. I’ll give Hurry Up credit for taking massive swings. This is a sensory based movie, and it could’ve easily been a visual album, but I guess I gotta give kudos to the team for trying their hand at making an original movie. This is a psychological thriller? Or is it an existential crisis drama? Either way, I get what Weeknd was trying here. Amongst the many wild camera movements and flowing lights shocking your eyes, there’s an inner dialogue being played out here. Abel has improved slightly in terms of his performing abilities as an actor (he’s better here than he was on “The Idol”), and there are moments which seem like he’s made genuine strides as an actor. Maybe its because this is a personal story for him, and he obviously has a lot of personal life events added in here to give him and the story that much more depth. But he’s tried here, so I’ll give him that. The inner dialogue is shown outright through the performances of Barry Keoghan and Jenna Ortega (who, in my opinion, steals the show here). They both play out facets of the Weeknd persona, both mentally and metaphorically. Keoghan’s character can be interpreted as ego and control, whereas Ortega’s character can be interpreted as his soul that craves for happiness and love, while also relishing to be comforted amongst the chaos. I guess the issue is that the film doesn’t necessarily do as good of a job as possible to show these things. In my opinion, it takes too much time focusing on the visual aspect of things. This is a cathartic film, and by the end of the movie, you see the burning away of the past self and Abel moving forward with his work. Is this supposed to represent him burning the bridge of his artistic past and moving forward by forging an artistic identity as his real self? Was that Misery portion a sort of therapy session to confront and deal with past album’s dialogues to fully comprehend what shall be done for his future work moving forward? Or was this all just a carte blanche project to help sell more albums and concert tickets? Either way, there’s interesting stuff here, but it didn’t work as much as I wanted it to. Still was never bored at any point, but will say I was perplexed and baffled by some choices here.",

    "title": "Movie Review - Final Destination Bloodlines",
    "selftext": "https://youtu.be/exe8Nz22i7Y?feature=shared\n\nFinal Destination Bloodlines - 8/10. Well I guess I skipped number 5 before I got to see the new instalment. “Final Destination Bloodlines” follows the formula that fans have grown to love with the series, but, there’s some slight twists and turns along the way. But before I get into this film it self, I wanna say: that was such a beautiful send off for Tony Todd. Its really rare a franchise is able to send off a character or star in a very poignant or meaningful manner. And here, Todd delivers his last performance, which feels prophetic and heartwarming. Its almost as though he knew, and the way his scene goes about you can’t help but feel that this was a beautiful sendoff to a horror icon. Not only do they honour him as an actor, but they also surprisingly bring some depth and closure for his character in the franchise too (something I wasn’t really expecting, but pleasantly surprised by). Now, for the film. For starters, I would still say the original is the best, the third is the second best, and this one is probably the third best in the series. What Bloodlines does smartly is that the film is super aware about the goings of a Final Destination story. This is definitely, by far, the most self aware film in the franchise thus far. You can also put up an argument that this might be the fastest paced film in the franchise (once it gets into the eventual premonitions and deaths). But ironically, its not a Final Destination film that I will compare this to. In fact, I would say this is the Final Destination adaptation of the 2018 instalment in the “Halloween” franchise. Like that film, we have characters here who have cheated death, and that has caused turmoil in their personal lives, so much so that they either become paranoid shut ins, or, absentee parents. I was really surprised how much this movie borrowed from that instalment (not that I’m complaining, cause I like that film). The movie’s set pieces are fun, and the first and last set pieces are done in a big manner (though, the CGI is just a little distracting to be honest). There’s some creativity with the premonitions here, and the story is actually quite interesting as well. The continuity that the franchise really celebrates upon is also respected here as well, as we do get connections to past events (even if its not jaw dropping). Overall though, this is a solid return for the franchise, and a fun one at that.",

    "selftext": "After taking over Mission: Impossible in its fifth entry—and arguably delivering the best installment—Christopher McQuarrie decided to stick around and break the franchise’s tradition of rotating directors. Despite bigger budgets and scope, every film felt like a smaller version of what came before—though this one is a small improvement over the previous film, which was easily the franchise’s lowest point.\n\nGiving the keys to a single director, in my eyes, stripped the series of what made it unique in the first place. Even in its weaker entries (MI:2 is still the punching bag), there was something exciting about seeing directors like Brad Bird bring cartoon energy, or Abrams come in with his mystery-box storytelling. More importantly, it made the franchise feel bigger than just one person’s vision.\n\nThere’s a reason Ethan Hunt never became a James Bond or Jason Bourne. He’s not exactly a deep character. He’s a do-gooder—kind of bland—and the only real personality came from Tom Cruise’s commitment. Even when they gave him a wife, it never mattered—she was gone by the next film and barely mentioned again.\n\nWhen McQuarrie came on for Rogue Nation, he was still being pulled in different directions. Cruise reportedly approached the composer directly to lighten up the score, adjusting it to something more in line with the older films. But as McQuarrie kept returning, he gained more control. He fired the composer, leaned harder into self-serious storytelling, and slowly turned the series into something closer to a Marvel finale—epic score, dense lore, and every thread needing to tie back to some past event. (Spectre and Rise of Skywalker PTSD) Heists took a back seat. The team dynamic shrank. And stunts became the main event—big, loud, “look what we captured for real” moments meant more to impress than involve.\n\nPS: i would rank this above 2 and 7 in the franchise.\n\nRead my full review at https://reviewsonreels.ca/2025/05/15/mission-impossible-the-final-reckoning/\n\nMy Favorite Scene: Gabriel escaping with his parachute.",

    "selftext": "The idea for Sound of Falling began with a photograph—three women from the 1920s, their lives left to the imagination. That image stayed with director Mascha Schilinski and eventually became the seed for her second feature. Over the course of nearly three years, she and co-writer Louise Peter developed a story that spans a century, following four girls who lived on the same German farm during different eras. Their lives are gently woven together in a structure that brings to mind the shifting timelines and themes of The Hours, Picnic at Hanging Rock, and The Virgin Suicides.\n\nLike those last two films, Schilinski is interested in the inner lives of girls and women—how they carry longing, navigate silence, and try to make sense of a world shaped by others. Even though these characters are separated by decades, they all share a quiet ache. From the very beginning, we see it through Alma, the youngest of the four, whose perspective is often framed by keyholes and narrow glimpses—always watching, always just outside. The other women may be older, but that same sense of distance and restlessness lingers in all of them.\n\nVisually, the film is often breathtaking (as shown in the beautiful still being used to promote the film). Shot in a 4:3 aspect ratio, the cinematography constantly presses in on its characters, placing them in tight frames and corners as if the world around them is closing in. The use of light and shadow, windows and reflections, makes nearly every frame feel carefully composed—and the number of shots that could be frozen and hung in a gallery is immense. It was only my first film at Cannes, but I find it hard to believe I’ll see anything more beautiful this year.\n\nRead my full review at https://reviewsonreels.ca/2025/05/14/sound-of-falling/",

    "title": "Thunderbolts*",
    "selftext": "*Thunderbolts\\** is a different kind of Marvel superhero movie.  Of course, that description comes with caveats.  It isn’t the first movie about a team who constantly snipe at each other.  (That would be the Guardians of the Galaxy.)  These are not the first superheroes haunted by the slings and arrows life has thrown at them.  (This applies to almost every Marvel superhero.)  And these heroes aren’t the first superheroes who are “grounded”–meaning that they can’t can’t fly and are reduced to punching and kicking at street level.  (Take your pick.)\n\nWhat is different about this movie is its focus.  Instead of the hero’s ongoing mental anguish providing texture in between action sequences, it is front-and-center in this movie.  The story is about how this group of bad guys get past their personal troubles and become the heroes they want to be.  It’s no spoiler to say that they get there by the end, but they do so in a way that represents a significant departure for the MCU in many ways.\n\nThere are still big action sequences in *Thunderbolts\\**, all of which are well-choreographed and filmed in a way reminiscent of the Netflix Marvel TV shows (that are now on Disney+).  I’d read that director Jake Schreier emphasized using practical effects as much as possible, and it shows.  It’s odd to praise a superhero movie for going the extra mile to ensure that the story looks like it takes place in real locations instead of CGI sets, but I’ll praise it nonetheless.\n\nAlthough *Thunderbolts\\** is about a team, it’s really the Florence Pugh show.  This says as much about Pugh’s star power as her acting abilities.  She’s been an exceptional actor for years now, and was nominated for an Academy Award when she was twenty.  If anyone wonders why she is so acclaimed, they only need to see this movie to understand why.  She infuses her character with so much self-loathing, residual trauma, ennui, anger, and sorrow that for long stretches the movie is a character study.  She delivers a monologue so gut-wrenching that it brought tears to my eyes.  It’s paradoxical that one of the least powerful superheroes is played by one of the MCU’s best actors, but it’s happened before so I won’t quibble.\n\n*Thunderbolts\\** may not be everyone’s idea of a good time at the movies, but I appreciated it for doing something (mostly) different and making me feel something I rarely feel about superheroes: compassion.  Like *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3*, it takes you to emotional places you never thought you’d go in a superhero movie.  **Recommended**.\n\n[https://detroitcineaste.net/2025/05/13/thunderbolts-movie-review-and-analysis-florence-pugh/](https://detroitcineaste.net/2025/05/13/thunderbolts-movie-review-and-analysis-florence-pugh/)",

    "selftext": "Friendship is a hilarious comedy that should especially please fans of cringe humor. Tim Robinson, best known for the Netflix sketch series I Think You Should Leave, brings his signature awkward style to the big screen in his first leading film role. Directed by Andrew DeYoung, the film also stars Paul Rudd and Kate Mara, who help ground this uncomfortable—but often laugh-out-loud—exploration of adult male friendship.\n\nRobinson plays Craig Waterman, a suburban dad whose job involves convincing customers to abandon their product returns—a fitting occupation for someone so naturally abrasive. Despite having a wife, Tami (Kate Mara), and a son, Craig’s life feels painfully hollow. He has no meaningful connections, no real hobbies, and no idea how to connect with people. That starts to change when he meets his new neighbor, Austin Carmichael (Paul Rudd), a charismatic local weatherman with an easygoing charm. Craig quickly becomes obsessed with Austin’s seemingly perfect life, especially once he’s invited into his circle of friends.\n\nWhat follows is a series of increasingly cringeworthy moments, mostly fueled by Craig misreading social cues and pushing boundaries. While the script is sharp and dotted with well-timed jokes, much of the comedy comes from simply watching Robinson and Rudd bounce off each other. Robinson fully embraces Craig’s most unbearable traits, never trying to make him overly sympathetic. Rudd, meanwhile, gives a performance reminiscent of his role in Only Murders in the Building—charming on the surface, with just enough edge to suggest there’s something simmering underneath. Together, they sell the film’s uneasy central dynamic.\n\nRead my full review at https://reviewsonreels.ca/2024/09/09/friendship-tiff24/",

Can we consider this as a sister project to “Dream Scenario?” Ironically, both films have a Nic Cage who is pestered and pushed to the brink of psychological demolition, but this film pushes him even further down. “The Surfer” is one of the most stressful watches for me this year. Its a contained film, happening pretty much around a small area around a beach in Australia. The movie it self truly pissed me off for the most part. Not because its a bad movie, but, how many of these characters are treating Cage’s character throughout. You know that saying in “Fight Club?” Well, technically it helped get popularized into popular culture, but the saying is, “in order to gain anything, you must first lose everything.” That is literally the plight of this main character to a tee. It really drove me up the wall how they treated his character. He didn’t deserve to be pushed to the extent that he was pushed to. I read that the director wanted the viewer to see how far his character will be beaten down, and in the case of that mission he was trying to accomplish, then he completed that mission with flying colours. Nic Cage is at an interesting junction of his career, and I appreciate him doing roles like this. This is a very raw and rough role, and he aces it. You really do feel sorry for him at points. I was totally invested in the film, but near the hour mark, I was just hoping for some sort of reprieve for Cage’s character. That’s why, when that ending happens, it made me release the stress that was building up throughout watching this. Surprising that it took this long for this film to be released!

Along their journey, they end up changing the viewpoints and lives of the neighbourhood their residing in, fully integrating themselves not just in the community, but in the people’s hearts. “Tourist Family” is a gentle dramedy, taking a situation like this and bringing the importance of compassion and humanity to the forefront. It felt like a mix of Frank Capra, “The Terminal,” “The Family” (in terms of a family that is in a new country and trying to integrate to the new society), and “Mozhi” (which seems like is the biggest inspiration here). Though I will admit, the accents are a little bit off here, the core idea in this film is beautiful. Maybe it feels like wishful thinking, but showing how living a life of care and thoughtfulness can change lives is an important thing to show in film nowadays. People are forgetting about the simple act of being a good human to one another, and this film is a reminder that simple acts and gestures can go a long way. The way I interpreted the family joining this community was akin to a guardian angel guiding these individuals. Sasikumar’s character is almost like a cousin to the character he played in “Ayothi,” but instead of going out of his way to help, here, he’s just going about life and just doing what he feels what feels right. Simran is still a top tier performer, and what a wonderful callback in her stage dance scene. I always loved her performances, and she proves here yet again she is a wonderful performer. Also, I couldn’t stop but think that she now looks just like my Sangeetham teacher from my childhood (one of the nicest people I ever met, and a person that genuinely encouraged me in music). What I also appreciated about this film is the family dynamic and the addition of comedy into sequences which could’ve easily been drawn out dramatic portions. Life is an interesting mixture of different emotions and an ebb and flow of positive and negatives. I feel like the film showed that here in a nice and pleasant way. At the end of the day, I hope the thing people can take from this is that compassion trumps negativity. Be kind, be welcoming, be warm. And remember: you might be away from your home, but home is where you decide it to be. Great film!",

    "title": "Thunderbolts* review",
    "selftext": "So, “Thunderbolts\\*” (yes, I’m keeping the asterisk in the title since that’s what Marvel did) is the newest MCU film. This one was directed by Jake Schreier, which is a big step up from directing music videos and single episodes of television shows (which comprise most of his body of work). Not to mention all of the various talent he got to work with this time around. For those that don’t know, let me give a quick rundown of all the main Marvel characters that appear in this film, since this isn’t like some of the previous ones. Some of these may be a little harder to remember.\n\nYelena (Pugh) will be mostly known for her turn as Natasha’s (Scarlett Johansson) sister in “Black Widow” and a quick showing in “Hawkeye”. Bucky Barnes (Stan) will be the most widely recognized since he’s appeared in eight other MCU movies and shows. Red Guardian or Alexei (Harbour), also from “Black Widow,” brought a lot of humor to the role. John Walker (Russell) is known so far for only his role in the show “The Falcon and The Winter Soldier”. Then, Ghost (Ava Starr, played by John-Kamen) from “Ant-Man and the Wasp” rounds out the main team of returning anti-heroes. Of course, none of this would be possible without Valentina (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), who accidentally brings them all together by failing to kill them.\n\nSo, to sum up the backstory, Valentina had each one of these working for her (except Bucky), doing various high-profile jobs. When the government had her backed to the wall, she decided to destroy all the evidence… including the people too. All of the characters mentioned above work together, except for Taskmaster (Olga Kurylenko), since they killed her off almost immediately. Surprising move since they had her in all of the pre-movie marketing. During all the fighting, however, someone named Bob was awakened from a deep sleep in some sort of pod where he was presumed dead.\n\nOverall, this is a great step in the right direction for the MCU and an amazing way to give some minor characters some major screentime. With them being dubbed as The New Avengers at the end of the movie, we can all but guarantee most (if not all) of them will show up in the next two Avengers films slated for release in the near future. Oh… and don’t sleep on that after-credit scene that gave me goosebumps. I’d have to go back and check my records, but this is probably one of the best movies I’ve seen so far in 2025. It’s up there with “Death of a Unicorn” and “Nosferatu” for sure, and I give it an 8 out of 10!\n\n[1guysmindlessmoviereviews.com/2025/05/05/thunderbolts/](https://1guysmindlessmoviereviews.com/2025/05/05/thunderbolts/)",

I have to give credit to my childhood self for being able to see how terrible this movie is, even back then. But don't get it twisted; I did have a lot of the toys that they shilled out for this abomination. There isn't a lot to say about this movie that hasn't already been said. The dialogue and one-liners are painfully unfun. The acting is abysmal. The action is corny. All around, this movie is just terribly cheesy. They butchered Bane. There isn't much that makes sense, blah blah, you get my point. So what were the positives then? Well, not much. Both Alicia Silverstone and Uma Thurman remain very attractive. That suit Batman, Robin, and Batgirl wear with the gray color in it remains cool. Both R. Kelly and Smashing Pumpkins released bangers of songs for this movie. And the watermelon Pop-Tart they released for this movie was off the chain. But yeah, this movie fucking sucks, and yet it isn't the worst superhero movie I have seen lately. Venom, Kraven, and Madame Web are all far worse than this. 3/10",

    "selftext": "**The Ugly Stepsister** isn’t your average fairy tale subversion. This isn’t revisionist fantasy where villains are reimagined with backstories and nuance. No, this is Cinderella as filtered through a body horror lens, which is gruesome, intimate, and psychologically unrelenting. \n\nDirector **Emilie Blichfeldt** doesn’t just deconstruct the mythos of the fairy tale, they disembowel it, stitch it back together with surgical thread, and let it bleed out across the frame.\n\nThe body horror here is not stylized or fantastical, it’s tactile, painful, and grounded in the grotesque reality of contemporary beauty culture. But yet, the gore serves a thematic purpose, and these aren’t shock sequences for the sake of it, they’re acts of psychological violence rendered physical. Each needle and incision underscores the film’s central concern of how societal pressures regarding beauty systematically disfigure women, not just physically, but emotionally and spiritually.\n\nThis is not a film for the faint of heart, but for those willing to sit with its discomfort, The Ugly Stepsister offers a challenging, visceral, and disturbingly relevant horror experience. It’s about what we do to women in the name of beauty. It’s about what women do to themselves to be loved. And it’s about how fairy tales, those sanitized stories we’ve grown up with, have always had blood on their hands. \n\n**Want more?** Read the full review on my site. I promise it’s just as (un)insightful, but with 17% more fairy tale trauma and 0% pop-up ads.

    "title": "The Sun's Burial (1960)",
    "selftext": "Director- Oshima Nagisa.\nThis is the eighth film I have seen of his. I have a good chance of going on the Oshima retrospective, having watched the Cruel Story of Youth of his recently.\nI watched this film because either I misread or the book Eros plus Massacre by David Desser wrote that this film is more optimistic than the Cruel Story of the Youth.\nThe Sun's burial is not as bleak as the Cruel Story of Youth, instead, it is much bleaker, with the darkness of humanity having a more prominent appearance in this.\nOne can also interpret the film to be about resilience and karma punishing the evildoers, but I see it as the weak just getting exploited with no chance of a better life.\nThe Sun in the film's title refers to the Sun generation, which refers to the disillusioned youth or people in general in the aftermath of World War two. It refers to the generation of youth ravaged by the commercial-materialistic society, which is reducing them to mere flesh and blood who can't do anything to change the times for the better.\nThis film does succeed in having a more optimistic protagonist. At the start, he is a hopeful person, but as the film goes on, he falls deeper into a life of crime. His morality is stranded on a grassy field, and he has to move forward in an aimless society without what was his main driving force.\nHis friend is the nihilistic one this time around, driven by selfish desires of money and lust. He resembles the protagonist of the Cruel Story of Youth.\nThe film features several gangs that are fighting over the same minuscule turf as a means to live a better life and to survive these desperate times. No matter how poor the quality of one's clothes may be, when they die, the others will ravage the corpse just to get those clothes.\nThe blood smugglers are using clinics to drain them of their blood for a measly amount, which is quite gloomy. But at the same time, the scenes of different characters robbing different dead bodies of the people they actually knew and fraternised with are even gloomier. The bodies left to the vultures in the slums make it even more gut-wrenching.\nThe location is told to us to be the slums under the sun, and is utterly grim. It makes us uncomfortable because we see the plight of the slum dwellers up close. Oshima doesn't shy in showing us the brutality and the backstabbing nature of the people who are trying everything they can to survive for another day.\nThe location may very well have been an inescapable hell, as one can never run away from it. The place breaks the hope of the people, leading them to lead aimless lives.\nThe location is the Kamagaasaki slums, which are used as a metaphor for all of Japan. The slums were created under a Meiji emperor who didn't wish to see slums throughout his journey from Hiroshima to Russia. Thus, it was clustered and moved away from the people's eyes.\nThe film shows us how unsuspecting poor people are taken advantage of by others and shows us a human trafficking ring's inner workings excellently.\nThe film also shows us the misogyny of the people excellently as well, with the people making use of the female lead's acumen in running a blood smuggling ring, but they aren't ready to pay her well enough for her efforts.\nThe film also shows us people who say they will leave this place and go to cities like Tokyo, but still do nothing to follow through with it.\nThe more films I see of early Oshima, the more it feels like he is not leaving anything he wants to say unsaid. He isn't allowing vultures to take his films and add or subtract anything to and from them.\nThe ending with the whole slum being ablaze felt like a last hurrah, and at the same time, felt like Oshima is telling us how the people inside could never dream outside of the confines till they stayed inside. Thus, the fire is forcing them to leave the safety of their slums towards an uncertain better future.\nOverall, this was another great film by Oshima, which makes me look forward to watching more of his films. I hope they will be as good as this as well.\n\nThe inclusion of a gang in Oshima's works refers to the Japanese condemnation of individuality and the favouring of herd mentality. In all cases our protagonist, the individual, is squashed down by the herd for wanting to move ahead and leave the rest behind. In this film's case it is a metaphor for the army of the nation that is causing the decline of the country with their codes of loyalty and obeisance.\nOshima also shows us that the gang demands absolute loyalty from the people, but it can betray a single member at any point in the name of the collective good in the same way a state does. It also shows us the economic-materialist basis of the modern state, with the gang's finding the trading of blood to be the most lucrative activity acting as an allegory for the state trading on the life's lifeblood of the people.\nUnlike Yakuza films, which ritualised the concept of girii or obligation by showing an insurmountable object and acting as an allegory for the working man, Oshima politicised the concept to mirror the state as a means to criticise it.",

Heartwarming, light, and simple films. “Nonnas” is much needed lighter affair, providing a nice story which marries two lovely subjects: food and community. Its a film about celebrating the food you grew up with, and the people that helped make that food so special. Steven Chbosky returns to directing with this movie. I know people love to hate “Dear Evan Hansen” (I personally think its over hated, but that’s just me), but his work with “Perks Of Being A Wallflower” will always resonate with me. Nonnas returns him to the form we saw early in his career, and he allows the warmth of the performances and story to propel this somewhat cliched narrative forward. In terms of performances, everyones solid here. Its really nice and wonderful to see Vince Vaughn in a lighter role here. I think he’s super underrated these days, and here, we get to see a more laid back and natural Vaughn. The supporting cast, which includes Hollywood royalty (Sarandon, Bracco, and Shire to name a few), are all charismatic and wonderful in their respective roles. Like I said before, the story is by the book, but its the overall packaging that makes this a pleasant watch. Great and light entertainment!",

Premiering at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival and only now reaching general audiences, *The Surfer* finds Cage fully committed to the strange and surreal, but the film itself struggles to justify its runtime or its ambitions.\n\nCage plays an unnamed American surfer returning to his childhood beach in Australia with hopes of buying back his old family home and reconnecting with his son. The trip quickly takes a bizarre turn when a territorial gang of local surfers, led by Julian McMahon’s Scally, humiliates him for being an outsider. The rule is clear: if you’re not from the area, you’re not welcome in the water. What follows is a slow descent into paranoia, madness, and sunbaked obsession as Cage’s character camps out near the beach, enduring harassment and psychological torment from the cult-like group.\n\n[More Movies Like 'The Surfer'](https://cinephilecorner.com/lists/movies-like-the-surfer/)",

While it doesn’t quite reach the inventive highs of [*Ghost Protocol*](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/mission-impossible-ghost-protocol-movie-review-2011/) before it or the exhilarating perfection of *Fallout* after it, *Rogue Nation* still stands tall as a taut, polished action film that continues the franchise’s upward trajectory in terms of scale, storytelling, and style.\n\nIf *Ghost Protocol* introduced the sleek, globe-trotting, stunt-driven model the series would come to be known for, then *Rogue Nation* solidified it. McQuarrie sets the tone for what’s to come, laying down the narrative groundwork and visual language that would fully bloom in later installments. While some of that setup means *Rogue Nation* occasionally feels like a bridge to *Fallout*, it never loses its identity.

It reminded me of Spotlight, the way it brought the issue of child molestation by the Catholic Church into focus - not just as isolated incidents, but as a systemic issue, showing how the vow of celibacy was leading to some priests to target children as an outlet for suppressed desires.\n\nSimilarly, in Conclave, the film explores >!the complexities of gender and identity within a framework that is deeply traditional and sacred for many - the Papacy.!< >!The character who is portrayed as the most kind-hearted and ultimately chosen as Pope becomes the one through whom they reveal a climactic truth about biological complexity.!<\n\nWhat’s brilliant is how they use that character to build sympathy and admiration, making the audience invested in them, and then challenge that sympathy by revealing their complex identity.   \n  \nIt forces viewers who are otherwise deeply aligned with Christian values to confront a nuanced reality.

The weird thing is, it already was on UK television back in the early parts of 2025, with it only getting a theatrical release now in North America. Its a by the books action film. You have a Josh Hartnett here who is seemingly relishing this stage in his career, where he gets to play over the top type characters in over the top type films. He’s having fun here, and you know what, that’s great to see. Movies like this are just made for the fun of it, and you can tell that everyone involved bought in and are playing up the over the top factors here. As a Tamil person of descent, its really cool to see another Tamil person being a lead here (Charithra Chandran). Its also interesting, and coincidental, that Hartnett’s last two films have involved Tamil talent at the forefront as well. With “Trap,” he worked with M. Night and his family, and here, its Charithra who happens to be his costar. Kinda cool if you ask me! But overall though, this movie is pretty familiar and cause of its budget, seems a little less in quality than say Bullet Train. But, it is fun, and it definitely passed the time. Also, I liked the ending and what it was kinda hinting at!",

    "selftext": "There remains hope that Joe Carnahan will someday recapture the artistic clarity and emotional depth of 2011’s The Grey, a film that stood as a striking genre piece—existential, visceral, and carried by a career-high Liam Neeson performance. Unfortunately, Shadow Force is yet another reminder that Carnahan’s recent projects, while occasionally fueled by interesting premises or fleeting moments of energy, fall short of that earlier standard.\n\nThe story shares some DNA with this year’s Back to Action, though here only one half of the couple has retired while the other remains active. Once the retired partner’s cover is blown, the pair reunite to protect their son and confront their former team. What follows is an uneven blend of family drama and action thriller, with diminishing returns as the film progresses.\n\nThe film benefits greatly from its committed cast. Omar Sy and especially Kerry Washington do more than the script asks of them, bringing real emotion and nuance to a setup that could’ve easily felt routine. Their chemistry—and their warm, charming scenes with their child, including a sweet family rendition of a Lionel Richie tune—provides the humanity the film otherwise struggles to sustain. Da’Vine Joy Randolph, fresh off her Oscar win for The Holdovers, is characteristically engaging, though the material mostly keeps her in her comfort zone. Mark Strong, meanwhile, delivers a few memorable moments as the antagonist—particularly during an early monologue opposite two henchmen—but is ultimately undercut by a screenplay that treats his menace with an inconsistent tone, veering into self-parody.\n\nRead my full review at https://reviewsonreels.ca/2025/05/09/shadow-force/",

    "selftext": "https://youtube.com/shorts/UPiEwi-SJU4?feature=shared\n\nClown In A Cornfield - 7/10. Got to see this at an advanced screening today! You know, the first half or so of this movie was going in a direction which seemed a bit slow and uninteresting in my honest opinion. You get the tropes you usually see in a teen slasher (new kid on the block, troubles with their respective parent(s), mysterious person/town, folklore of the scares, etc). It goes by the book, and it kinda feels a little too familiar and a little too on the nose. And then, the second half goes in the direction I was hoping for the film. What’s fun about “Clown In A Cornfield” is that it feels like a mix of “The Village,” “Hot Fuzz,” and any slasher with a clown. It actually creates for an interesting and over the top slasher, with a surprisingly fun and good sense of awareness of the cliches, and also, a surprising sociopolitical angle near the end too. Its also a movie that reminds you to never judge a film by its trailer, as by the look of the trailer, it seemed like a general run of the mill film. Had the first half been executed in a more better manner, this could’ve been a way better film. Either way, this was fun and entertaining when it got going and when it came towards the twist!",

    "selftext": "['Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol' Movie Review](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/mission-impossible-ghost-protocol-movie-review-2011/)\n\n*Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol* is where the franchise truly found its modern identity. Directed by Brad Bird in his first live-action feature after *The Incredibles*, *The Iron Giant*, and [*Ratatouille*](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/ratatouille-2007/), this fourth installment takes a massive leap forward in terms of scale, tone, and ambition. It doesn’t just raise the bar for the [*Mission: Impossible* series](https://cinephilecorner.com/lists/mission-impossible-movies-ranked/)—it redefines it, setting the stage for everything that would follow.\n\nFrom the very first minutes, *Ghost Protocol* feels larger-than-life. The centerpiece of the film—Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt scaling the Burj Khalifa—isn’t just a standout moment in the franchise; it’s one of the most breathtaking action set pieces of the 21st century. The sequence is both exhilarating and terrifying, made all the more compelling by the real-world stunt work that Cruise famously insisted on doing himself. It’s not just movie spectacle—it’s movie myth-making.\n\nThe plot hinges on a classic spy-thriller setup. After the Kremlin is bombed in a covert mission gone wrong, Ethan Hunt and his IMF team are blamed and disavowed under the “Ghost Protocol” directive. With no support and no backup, Hunt has to go rogue (again) to uncover the real perpetrators and prevent global catastrophe. It’s standard [*Mission: Impossible*](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/mission-impossible-1996-movie-review/) fare on paper, but in execution, Bird infuses it with energy, humor, and a visual style that separates it from anything that came before.",

    "selftext": "The movie is all protocol.  It's inaction, action, reaction, repeat (though it's never repetitive).  How effective it is seldom relies on the gunfire or explosions (which are thankfully fewer and farther between than expected) opting instead to let the memories of the Navy Seals who lived it do the dirty work with the details- along with pitch perfect sound and cinematography.  A lone stare is exchanged between two men before any damage has been done that is still front and center in my head as well as two others sharing a water bottle in the few moments of levity Warfare offers; at one point morphine is accidentally injected not to the wounded but the man administering it.  More often than not, these men are in shock and all functioning at an incredible tick that never defies its reality since the wheezing, long lost stares and screams of pain are ever present from the moment the chaos arrives.\n\nAlmost certain that this film achieved everything it wanted to and is a darker side of exhilarating that I haven't felt since the shootout in Saulnier's HOLD THE DARK.

    "title": "Sinners",
    "selftext": "Director- Ryan Coogler.\nThis is the fourth film I have seen of his, and each one has featured Michael B Jordan.\nI watched it in an IMAX only cause three of my friends were after me, and I am grateful to them. This was a seriously great experience to view in IMAX. The sound design of the film is awesome, and the music is impeccable. Ludwig Goransson is the real star in the film.\nThe intro of the film, offering glimpses of the events to be shown, is quite gripping. It makes one excited for the events to unfold.\nThis film features Michael B Jordan having a double role similar to Robert Pattinson in Mickey 17, but in Sinners' case, the twins make less sense as no one ever confuses them, the right one always shows up at the right place automatically. I think it is only to have Michael acting in the sequel as well, as we see in the post-credit scene. Also, for the Vampire Michael vs Human Michael fight scene.\nMichael wasn't able to act differently enough for the viewers to be able to separate the two. It's Michael and deeper voice Michael. In this regard, Robert Pattinson is far superior.\nThe vampires, for me, are a symbol of herd mentality in the face of a common enemy, the white American people. The original vampire is an Irish man, whose people too were colonised. Hence, the person also knows the Christian saying. Christianity was thrust upon both of their people.\nTheir sacrificing watching the sun is akin to sacrificing something to achieve independence. For me, it particularly refers to their collective culture, which they sacrifice to fit in.\nThe film shows us how the vampires are asking others to join them to be free, but asking for their lives and the ability to walk in sunlight in return. He isn't really making them any freer with the hive-minded nature of them.\nThe film is kind of a musical, and thus music is one of its major elements. The film successfully nails it, and the music is a treat in an IMAX sound system. The songs the vampires sing show their hive-mindedness quite well, while the song of Sammie merges the past, present and future. It feels like he may be either opening a portal to the realms, or his music is powerful enough to make people imagine things.\nThe imagery of Sammie singing while the mill burns can be compared to the vampires burning under the sunlight at dawn. This shows us how fire is what frees the people, may they be African or Irish, humans or vampires.\nThe vampires could also be a symbol for record labels that try to get new talent and force them to fit into the preconceived narrative, which the musician had earlier sought to break free from. They are invited in by contracts, and they make the musicians conform to uniformity.\nThe vampires are dealt with in fairly simplistic ways, though. Put a stake in their heart, throw garlic on them or burn them in sunlight. These offered no new take on it. Also, they can't enter till they are invited in.\nThe only innovation they added was that killing the original vampire will only inflict mental scars and incapacitate the others for a short time, but won't kill them outright. This was done to make a sequel of this film, I must say, as was teased in the post-credit scene.\nThe village is shown to be quite conservative, with them forgetting their roots and embracing colonial teachings. The nearby village is said to be biased against one's relatives being on the evil side, according to them. This shows us how even their own people are prejudiced against them.\nThe story of the twins and their father is only ever told to us in bits, which makes us pay more attention to the details as it does not lay it all out for us.\nThe John Wick-like action sequence near the end was interesting and came out of left field. Didn't expect the shootout at all.\nThe film has about three to four points where it could have ended, but still went on, this is one of them.\nThe film's first half and ending are impeccable, but the events in between are subpar. It feels like that part was written at the end just to reach from point A to point B. From the love interest going out to the Chinese lady inviting them in, everything feels forced and rushed. The rushed nature improves the suspense and puts us in their shoes better, but the forced nature pulls the film down a few pegs.\nThe film is not a completely original work and bears many similarities to Dusk till Dawn. Though this film is much better than that B-grade campy horror flick.\nOverall, this is a great film, but far from a masterpiece that others are making it out to be. This is a strong contender for this year's Oscars and may even win, given its pr campaign on social media.",

    "selftext": "Fight or Flight earns plenty of frequent flyer miles for blond Josh Hartnett going full lunatic once again. The actor, who had a bit of a comeback in 2023’s Oppenheimer—and an even bigger one anchoring M. Night Shyamalan’s Trap—brings that same commitment to director James Madigan’s modestly budgeted debut. He plays Lucas Reyes, an exiled American mercenary offered a shot at redemption if he can identify a criminal known only as “The Ghost” during a flight from Bangkok to San Francisco. The catch? He’s not the only one on board hunting for the same target.\n\nIn a nutshell, the film is a leaner Bullet Train—stripped of the bloated runtime, A-list budget, and overly convoluted plotting (and I say that as someone who liked Bullet Train, even if it was a bit much). Fight or Flight delivers some inventive action, and at 46, Hartnett reportedly did most of his own stunts. You can feel the budget being stretched thin—some of the effects are a bit clunky, which is surprising given that Madigan comes from a visual effects background. He clearly swings big, staging five or six major action set pieces, maybe more than the film can comfortably afford.\n\nRead my full review at: https://reviewsonreels.ca/2025/05/08/fight-or-flight/",

    "selftext": "[Full 'Mission: Impossible' Movie Review](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/mission-impossible-1996-movie-review/)\n\n*Mission: Impossible* marked the launch of one of modern cinema’s [most enduring and evolving action franchises](https://cinephilecorner.com/lists/mission-impossible-movies-ranked/). Directed by Brian De Palma and headlined by Tom Cruise ([*Magnolia*](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/magnolia-movie-1999/), [*Top Gun: Maverick*](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/top-gun-maverick-2022/)) as IMF agent Ethan Hunt, the film laid the foundation for what would become a signature series filled with high-stakes espionage, elaborate set pieces, and a commitment to practical stunt work that would grow increasingly daring with each sequel. Though the franchise would shift gears with different directors and tones, the original *Mission: Impossible* remains a sleek, stylish, and highly entertaining entry point into the unpredictable world of Ethan Hunt.\n\nAt its core, the plot is relatively simple but cleverly executed: after a covert IMF operation goes disastrously wrong, Ethan finds himself the sole survivor and the prime suspect in a conspiracy that implicates his entire team. The mission was led by his superior Jim Phelps (played by Jon Voight), and the apparent betrayal and ensuing cat-and-mouse unraveling set the tone for the series’ emphasis on deception, double-crosses, and shadowy alliances. On the run from his own government, Hunt assembles a new team to uncover the truth and clear his name.\n\n[Movies Like 'Mission: Impossible'](https://cinephilecorner.com/lists/movies-like-mission-impossible/)",

    "title": "Sinners",
    "selftext": "On the level of cinematic spectacle, *Sinners* is a thrilling sensual experience.  Writer-director Ryan Coogler and cinematographer Autumn Durald Arkapaw fill this movie with jaw-dropping imagery.  From breathtaking shots of expansive Arkansas farmland, to views of sweaty juke joint patrons dancing to the two confrontations at the end of the story, the film is a feast for the eyes.  The soundtrack throbs with the sounds of music and the moans of characters in the throws of passion.  If you only ever see this movie on your television, that would be a mistake because Coogler made this film to be experienced on a big screen with an audience.\n\nOn the narrative side, the movie works best when it describes what music means, from historical, communal and racial perspectives.  There’s a tour de force scene midway through that gives one of the best depictions of how music both connects us and transports us backward and forward in time.  What we see and hear borders on the mystical, and may end up being the signature scene of 2025.\n\nIf only Coogler had kept this movie on that trajectory.  Instead, he delves into horror movie tropes to make several murky philosophical observations about revenge sought by oppressed races and the voraciousness of popular (white) culture.  While I have no issue with the points being made, the tonal shift that accompanies them detracts from the film’s compelling spiritual investigation.  By the time Coogler course-corrects to unify his overarching themes, the film’s momentum has almost been lost.  For all of Coogler’s confidence in taking us on this journey, his risky swerve into the supernatural nearly sabotages the entire enterprise.\n\nFortunately, everything before and after that episode borders on greatness.  The performances are electric across the board.  Michael B Jordan continues proving that he is a star playing twin brothers.  Having him playing twins doesn’t add anything to the story, but it’s a fun flex on behalf of Coogler and the visual effects team pulling this off.  (Watch Jordan share a cigarette with himself!)  The movie is a showcase for all of its female actors, with Jayme Lawson, Hailee Steinfeld and Tenaj L. Jackson each taking turns setting the camera ablaze.  Not to be outdone are Miles Caton, incredible in his first acting role, and veteran Delroy Lindo stealing every scene he’s in.\n\n*Sinners* is a bravura piece of filmmaking on behalf of Ryan Coogler, a richly sensual spectacle that confidently explores the both good and bad aspects of African Americans living in the Deep South of the 1930s.  The movie is an audacious work of art, full of ideas rendered in breathtaking imagery, with captivating performances and soul-stirring music.  Although a few of Coogler’s risks nearly derail the enterprise, the film’s raw, emotional power is undeniable.  **Recommended**.\n\n[https://detroitcineaste.net/2025/05/06/sinners-movie-review-and-analysis-ryan-coogler-michael-b-jordan-hailee-steinfeld/](https://detroitcineaste.net/2025/05/06/sinners-movie-review-and-analysis-ryan-coogler-michael-b-jordan-hailee-steinfeld/)",

    "selftext": "Totally side tangent why are so many movies called romcom's even when the movie clearly puts zero intent into it being a comedy? Ok onto the movie, you can tell early on how the movie is kind of going to go. Essentially the guy (Dave) has a monster crush on a friend that sees him in only a platonic light. The other main character (Aubrey) has a BF but clearly views him as more of a place holder than something super serious. They (Dave/Aubrey) meet in a alley outside of some party, strike up some conversation. At first Dave reads out to Aubrey what he plans to tell Jane (his crush) but she thinks Jane won't go for that kind of thing. Anyways over time it becomes obvious they are both into each other, she invites him over (not to have sex or anything, btw both are virgins).\n\nThey get to talking but it becomes more and more clear over time that they are both into each other, at one point Aubrey talks about wanting to meet a guy the old fashioned way. Dave says something along the lines of \"What about a crazy guy talking to himself in a dark alley\" (alluding to himself). She asks him to give  her his hand, and they hold hands and cuddle (they have clothes on), she says she has problems sleeping with someone around, he says he can leave and she doesn't have to explain herself. But then she suggests she can clothes her eyes for a minute and see what happens, they fall asleep. Next morning mom wakes them up and he has to climb outside the upstairs window and jump down from roof. He's ok.\n\nThat's really only the first half of the movie and I have left out the main plot, imo it is a very good underrated movie, the script is decent but the 2 lead actors (Britt Robertson/Dylan O'Brien) were spectacular, their chemistry was terrific. \n\nI've watched it multiple times and enjoyed it even knowing what is coming next. 8.5/10 for me ",

    "title": "Until Dawn (2025) - A Hollow Loop of Deaths.",
    "selftext": "Adding to the pile of disappointing video game adaptations, Until Dawn reimagines the familiar “group of friends in a cabin” setup with a time loop gimmick—meant to mimic the game’s branching outcome system, where player choices shape the story. In theory, this should be a clever way to translate interactivity into film. In practice, it mostly feels like narrative stalling.\n\nThe group of six friends fits the usual horror movie mold, but to the film’s credit, the first loop does a good job establishing their relationships. They come across as people who genuinely care for each other, which makes those early scenes more engaging than expected. That opening loop is also the film at its most compelling—there’s a clever idea involving how the area’s weather behaves, and the discovery of photos of missing people adds just the right amount of eerie mystery.\n\nAs a fan of time loop stories, I was on board for a while—until the film started unraveling its larger mythology. The explanation behind the loop is both confusing and disappointingly unoriginal, framing everything as some kind of experiment on fear. Once that layer is revealed, the movie starts to lose steam. There’s a complete lack of urgency, and the actual stakes are only clarified far too late.\n\n\nRead my full review at: https://reviewsonreels.ca/2025/05/05/until-dawn/",

    "title": "ApoKalypse (2025)",
    "selftext": "\"ApoKalypse,\" the recently released animated feature, is a surprisingly entertaining ride, especially considering its visibly ultra-low budget. While it won't be sweeping any major awards for technical prowess, its quirky humor, surprisingly endearing characters, and a truly unexpected cameo from the infamous Uwe Boll make it a worthwhile watch for fans of indie animation and zombie comedies.\n\nThe film throws us into the fluorescent-lit, slowly dying Crown Center Plaza, where we meet 21-year-old Apo Guerrero. Apo dreams of ditching his gig at the aptly named \"Bunz of Steel\" burger joint to become a pro skateboarder, much to the chagrin of his traditional father. When he's not slinging burgers with his best friend Jamal or co-designing custom skateboard gear for their brand \"Air Crown Jewelz,\" Apo attempts to woo Cho, who works at her family's Korean chicken restaurant across the food court.\n\nThe mundane mall life takes a sharp, bizarre turn when a conspiracy theory podcast popularizes \"Ratartarre,\" a rat poison hilariously and horrifyingly marketed as a miracle COVID cure. Thanks to a mall-wide promotion orchestrated by the oblivious manager, Mr. DeGeneres, the plaza is soon overrun by a horde of entitled shoppers, predominantly the \"Karen\" archetype, eager to get their hands on the bogus remedy. The chaos truly ignites when one such customer ingests Ratartarre at Bunz of Steel and undergoes a grotesque, Kafka-esque transformation into something decidedly inhuman and aggressive.\n\nWhat follows is a frantic, often silly, battle for survival as these \"brain deads,\" as Apo and Jamal christen them, begin to multiply. The film cleverly plays with the zombie trope, giving its initial wave of infected distinct \"Karen\" personalities and later introducing uniquely themed brain deads tied to the mall's various stores. Apo soon discovers that these creatures have peculiar vulnerabilities, adding a layer of strategy to the ensuing mayhem.\n\nAs the U.S. Army, led by a xenophobic Sergeant Major convinced this is a Chinese bioweapon, quarantines the mall, Apo, Jamal, and Cho must use their wits, skateboarding skills, and an assortment of mall-scavenged weaponry to find an escape. Along their journey, they cross paths with a cast of colorful survivors, including the eccentric gun store owner Ruby and the comically overzealous security guard Ken.\n\n\"ApoKalypse\" stumbles at times with its animation quality, which is undeniably basic. Character movements can be stiff, and backgrounds are often simplistic. However, the film's visual style has a certain charm, and it leans into its limitations with a knowing wink. The voice acting is enthusiastic, and the script, while not groundbreaking, delivers some genuinely funny lines and satirical jabs at consumer culture, conspiracy theories, and even office politics amongst the undead.\n\nThe budding romance between Apo and Cho, set against the backdrop of retail hell and a zombie apocalypse, adds a touch of sweetness to the gory proceedings. The film also manages to touch upon themes of generational conflict and chasing one's dreams, even if it's amidst a zombie outbreak. And yes, keep your eyes peeled for a bizarre, blink-and-you'll-miss-it appearance by none other than Uwe Boll, in a role that perfectly suits his notorious reputation.\n\n\"ApoKalypse\" isn't a masterpiece of animation, but it's a testament to what can be achieved with passion and a shoestring budget. It's a fun, unpretentious, and surprisingly inventive little film that offers more genuine laughs and heart than many of its big-budget counterparts. If you can look past the rough-around-the-edges animation, you'll find a good time, not an excellent one, but certainly a memorable one, at the Crown Center Plaza.",

    "title": "Rust (2025) - A Western Haunted by Real Loss.",
    "selftext": "Joel Souza’s indie Western Rust will forever be overshadowed by real-life tragedy. During a rehearsal scene in 2021, Alec Baldwin accidentally and fatally shot cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and injured Souza himself. The incident made international headlines and forced the film industry to take a harder look at on-set safety, prompting stricter regulations. At the time, the film was only halfway finished, and production was shut down indefinitely.\n\nNearly two years later, filming quietly resumed with the support of Hutchins’ family, who also received the rights to any future profits. After a limited festival run in 2024, Rust finally arrived in U.S. cinemas and on streaming platforms in May 2025, drawing mild curiosity from filmgoers eager to see the end result of a production so marked by tragedy. Some argue the film should never have resumed, but given that Hutchins’ family approved it—and her final work is genuinely impressive—I personally believe it’s the best possible outcome in an impossible situation.\n\nWhat makes it even harder to separate the movie from the tragedy is that the story itself also centers on an accidental killing. It follows Lucas, a 13-year-old caring for his younger brother after the deaths of their parents, who accidentally kills a man and is sentenced to hang. His grandfather Harland Rust (Alec Baldwin), a wanted outlaw, comes to his rescue, and the two flee across New Mexico with a bounty on their heads.\n\nThe premise isn’t particularly original and unfolds at a pace that can feel drawn out, spending too much time with a secondary cast of bounty hunters. Still, the film’s arresting visuals and the central bond—especially thanks to Patrick Scott McDermott’s remarkably mature performance—hold it together.\n\n\nRead my full review at: https://reviewsonreels.ca/2025/05/04/rust/",

Grander doesn’t mean better. We are shifted from a town setting to the coastal beauty of Italy, and though this beauty helps make the film look nicer than the original, it doesn’t mask the sequel’s deficiencies. Whatever worked in the original is vacant here, with the characters that worked so well in the original being brought down to kind of okay characters now. Anna Kendrick is really trying hard here, but she is left with nothing to work out with, leading her to just be okay. She was the emotional heartbeat of the original, and here she’s just here for the sake of continuity. Blake Lively’s best performance happened to be in the original. Her character was a ghost like figure who wasn’t in the film throughout, but had given a strong enough performance to leave a last presence throughout the narrative. Here however, her character’s mysterious mystique is not that interesting anymore, and even the twist felt forced and just tired. Henry Golding is reduced to being a bumbling alcoholic which is super disappointing, as his character was actually interesting as well in the original. The rest of the cast is okay I guess, the writing has taken a step down here, and the direction isn’t as snappy or tantalizing as the original. Sadly, Paul Feig follows the original with a sequel that just feels unnecessary and lacking the spark that made the first actually good to begin with. Disappointing!",

    "selftext": "The first thing you need to know about this movie is that it won’t be playing widely in theaters or even on your go-to streaming platforms. For most people, it will only be accessible through the movie’s website, [HenryJohnsonMovie.com](http://HenryJohnsonMovie.com), where you can rent it starting May 9th for eight bucks, as they have apparently opted for the Louis CK model. I’m not sure of the business decisions that went into this release model, but I imagine it’s going to severely limit the amount of people who watch the movie and journalists/critics who give it coverage. In fact, you’re probably wondering right now if it’s worth going through the extra hassle to watch it. I’m here to say…it is. This is a great movie, and yet another feather in the cap of David Mamet, which has so many feathers in it at this point that you could push him off a cliff and he’d float to the bottom. \n\nMamet is most well-known for his dialogue, and with Henry Johnson, he’s not going through some late-career phase transition. This is more of Mamet doing what he does best, and there are no signs of deterioration. I’ve never seen or read the play, but it appears that there was little effort to “cinema-fy” it. There are only four actors and maybe a handful of locations. No establishing shots, no frills, just the actors and dialogue. \n\nFor my full review, find it on YouTube: [https://youtu.be/dvIRKuqBcC0](https://youtu.be/dvIRKuqBcC0)",

    "selftext": "Fritz the cat (1972)\n\nFritz the Cat. The animated film that broke the mold, shattered boundaries, and forever changed the landscape of adult animation.\nReleased in 1972 and directed by the legendary animator Ralph Bakshi, Fritz the Cat is an adaptation of Robert Crumb's underground comic strip. This film was unlike anything that had come before it, pushing the boundaries of what was considered acceptable in animation and storytelling.\nOne of the most striking aspects of Fritz the Cat is its animation style. Bakshi's use of vibrant colors, intricate detailing, and off-kilter perspectives created a visually stunning world that drew viewers. The film's animation was a far cry from the clean, wholesome images typically associated with animated films, think of the happy and rosy Disney films, instead opting for a gritty, edgy aesthetic that helped set it apart.\nit wasn't just the animation style that set Fritz the Cat apart – it was also the film's bold and unapologetic storytelling. Fritz the Cat dared to tackle taboo subjects such as sex, drugs, and politics in a way that had never been done before in animation. The film's protagonist, Fritz, is a hedonistic and rebellious feline who navigates the tumultuous social landscape of 1960s America, engaging in all manner of provocative and controversial activities along the way.\nFritz the Cat's cast of characters is just as varied and eclectic as its subject matter. From drug-dealing crows to militant revolutionaries, each character in the film is a memorable and unique presence that adds depth and richness to the story. Fritz's interactions with these characters serve to highlight the complexity and absurdity of the world he inhabits, creating a memorable experience for viewers.\nPerhaps the most groundbreaking aspect of Fritz the Cat is its fearless social commentary and satire. The film doesn't shy away from addressing the pressing issues of its time, from the Vietnam War to the Civil Rights movement, using humor and wit to deliver pointed critiques of society. Fritz the Cat's willingness to tackle these weighty subjects head-on set it apart from other animated films of the era, establishing it as a bold and boundary-pushing work of art.\nOf course, Fritz the Cat was not without its controversies. The film's graphic depictions of sex and violence, as well as its unflinching portrayal of taboo subjects, sparked outrage. Fritz the Cat was banned in several countries and faced backlash from critics who found its content to be too provocative and unsettling.\nDespite these controversies, Fritz the Cat remains a landmark film that continues to be celebrated and studied to this day. Its influence can be seen in the work of countless animators and filmmakers who have been inspired by its boldness and creativity. Fritz the Cat's legacy as a groundbreaking work of animation is secure, and its impact on the medium will be felt for generations to come.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ew_C9QjCRA4?si=jqDqQip9t9f2kJMe",

    "title": "Movie Review - Death Of A Unicorn",
    "selftext": "https://youtube.com/shorts/zdD_kAiX6_s?feature=shared\n\nDeath Of A Unicorn - 7/10. A24 produces this unique creature feature with some superstar talent involved (Jenna Ortega, Paul Rudd, Will Poulter, and Tea Leoni to name a few). “Death Of A Unicorn” is a decent horror comedy, with an interesting premise and creatures that they focus on (who would have thought unicorns could be the subjects of a horror movie). It starts off pretty promisingly, but loses a bit of steam once the film gets stuck in the mansion of the rich client that Paul Rudd’s character is working for. The main issue here is that the concept is funny, and the scenario is a little funny too. However, outside of some lines from Poulter, the actual hilarity in this movie is a little too far and few between. The horror elements are actually well done, though, its pretty evident that the director has borrowed from the “Jurassic Park” series. The way the unicorns snarl and are menacingly taunting the group stuck in the home is very much like the Raptor sequences from the original, whereas the plot point of the unicorns attacking back to regain their baby is pretty much a major plot point in “The Lost World: Jurassic Park.” To be honest, this could’ve been a very solid film, had it been given a bigger budget. You can tell that the director had some grand ideas in store, but had to make the film a little enclosed at points in order to adhere to the budget in hand. The universe viewing scenes when in contact with the unicorn horn was cool to see, but we’ve seen that before in other films. The performances are solid, and the overall idea and commentary is good, but this is a case of a film that should’ve and could’ve aimed higher with its aspirations.",

    "title": "Movie Review - Thunderbolts*",
    "selftext": "https://youtu.be/KZOkSqHWSJo?feature=shared\n\nThunderbolts* - 9/10. I’m surprised! Didn’t expect this film to be as good as it got, but I’m glad it ended up being the way that it was! “Thunderbolts*” (or is it something else “wink wink”) is a surprisingly layered Marvel film, and definitely the best dramatic film in the MCU in a while. What seems like an on the surface team up movie with various different antihero/side characters, ends up being a psychological study towards these heroes and their respective inner thoughts and troubles. What’s so interesting is that what could’ve easily been a big budget extravaganza fight at the end turns into an analysis of what is troubling our heroes. We go into this “Inception” like mind room situation which allows our characters to try and reason with the “villain” of the story. What this sequence really is is an opportunity to finally get a Marvel film that circumvents and goes against expectations. Whatever you expect to see in a film of this kinda nature is there, but not in the heavy manner you expect in a team up Marvel film. You can tell that this project was given the same kinda leeway that was given when James Gunn presented the “Guardians Of The Galaxy” franchise. We actually get to know our heroes in a more deeper sense, outside of their heroics and all. This is more of a calculated character piece on a grander scale, and I’m happy that Marvel seems to finally, finally, be giving into allowing the director and writer free reign to try new things out. This is what Marvel needs to commission moving forward: more tries and more experimental films within the Marvel format. The performances are solid, and they’re mainly solid because they actually have interesting stuff to work with here. It’s not just catchphrases and jokes they need to say (though there is that here). Rather, we actually see them embody the human side of their respective characters. The movie overall is an interesting one at that. Though, I will say I did feel like this kinda felt like an overlong tv episode, overall however, Thunderbolts* is very much a nice and better step in the right direction for Marvel.",

Ironically, the one good thing about this movie was that visually the movie WAS actually stunning, but the writing was insufferable not just in bland, meaningless dialogue, but a completely incoherent plot, with no stakes, no understanding of the protagonist's (or really any of the characters) motivation, and no resolution between the protagonist and any of the antagonists, who only really become true antsgonists late in the movie. \n\nI will say that the actors who played the evil rich family were actually pretty good and realistic, despite being unknowns, but the two big stars, Adrian Brody and Felicity Jones, were really bland with very little meaningful presence on the screen, and I know thats just cause of the directing cause Ive seen both of them hit it out of the park before. \n\nAnother character I tjojght could have been really interesting was the neice, but ultimately we know nothign about why she is the way she is or does the things she does, what little they are. Why even bother?\n \nIf that doesnt paint a clear enough picture, I'll tell you what it reminded me of the whole time- Napoleon. Visually great, a story with very insteresting premise, awful character direction that wastes good talent, and IT WAS THREE HOURS LONG. At least Brady Corbett had the decency to put an intermission in there though. Hed be great for directing music videos. Or maybe porn. The whole thing was one of those mpvies where it jus felt like the director was... jacking off.",

Yet another film where beautiful women (especially in positions of authority) just want to be spanked and biased around by a Big Daddy who *really* shows her who’s in charge in the bedroom; tedious.

    "title": "Movie Review - Retro",
    "selftext": "https://youtu.be/zJNVDrnjERs?feature=shared\n\nRetro - 9/10. Love, laughter, war, destiny, and purpose. “Retro” is another 2 in 1 film from Karthik Subbaraj, where the tale of two halves has the first half being a colourful and tantalizing gangster love story, and the second half is a gangster who ends up fulfilling his pre ordained destiny as a saviour. For some, this will be a divisive watch. I’m surprised to see some people not liking the second half, as it was the first half that didn’t necessarily work out for me. Tonally, there’s a ton going on (not in a horrible manner), but it all starts to settle at the second half. This is Karthik Subbaraj’s “Raavanan” in a sense (retelling an old tale in modern times), with the subject being Lord Krishna as the main source of narrative. Here, we have an individual who is on a journey to get a purpose in their respective life. Suriya’s Paari (another brilliant performance from him, and a surprisingly wide spanning one as well) is in search of love, while having the non ability of laughter (the lack of genuine love could be a reason why he can’t laugh). He is brought up by a gangster, who hates the notion of the child, but only grows to love the concept of him once he sees the brute force violence the child is capable of. So, Paari leads with violence as his purpose in life. Once Paari reunites with Pooja Hegde’s Rukmini (who actually probably delivers her career best here), he believes that her love and the life he can lead with her is his new purpose. A certain event happens during his wedding (during a technically brilliant single shot sequence surrounding the hit song “Kanima”) causes Paari’s life to be thrown into turmoil, throwing him in a journey that somehow leads him to finding some laughter in his life. With another destiny spinning turn leading to the war of his life, Paari enters a “Mortal Kombat” like competition, which leads him to finally finding his true purpose in life: becoming “The One” for his people. Its a predictable and pretty standard story, but knowing Karthik’s treatment in narrative and visuals, it was never going to be a standard film. Retro is all over the place and surprisingly does a fairly good job at covering those sectors. Its also a film which has a lot to say to its respective audience. There’s certain sequences which really worked for me. The laughing/smiling sequences where Paari finally shows the emotion, and the final sequence where the oppressed laugh in the face of the oppressors were really impactful and somehow fit into the film without feeling cringey or out of place. The scene where the people see Paari come out of the water with birthmark visible was shot so well, and it kind of made me think that it was almost a narrative baptizing of the character. There’s a goofy tone and nature in the first half that kind of caught me off guard, but by the second half things settle in quite nicely. Karthik’s trademark socio political commentary is on full display here (which I appreciate as always). Once you get to the last 20/30 minutes of the film, you’ll know exactly what the commentary is based on. Suriya, the actor, is on full display here. He gets to shine and show so much range here, and its a surprisingly in depth and layered role in what naturally could’ve been a standard film. Santhosh Narayan always saves his best for Karthik, as he delivers solid work again here. Shreyaas Krishna again delivers some incredible cinematography here, providing some incredibly in depth focus and visually tantalizing palette here. He truly is one of the MVPs of this film. I will understand why some won’t like this as much as I did, but for me, I appreciated Karthik’s viewpoint on his way of making a commercial film. This is his interpretation of those masala/commercial films of the 70s/80s/90s. This is an homage to Bruce Lee films, Mani Ratnam, Kubrick’s “Spartacus,” “Gladiator,” and even “The Matrix.” Its an homage to the film’s he grew up with, and I love when a director shines a little beacon of light towards what inspired them. Its also a movie that emphasizes on the tenets of some people’s lives. We all have a different destiny, even if we follow the same path (something Karthik has already touched upon in his great “Mahaan”). We should also love, laugh, and war when need be. Live to love, love to laugh, fight for your love, and just go about your life with as much passion and flair as possible. A solid outing, and it did work the trick for me for the most part!",

Even I expected some new and entertaining but nope.\n \nThe first half kept me hooked because of the father son differences, I thought they'll deal with this in the whole movie. But the makers gave it a whole different treatment, which was not entertaining and the main reason for this is I guess it's because of the villain being not so dangerous.

    "title": "More of my Favorite B Grade Movies",
    "selftext": "There's nothing more entertaining on a rainy afternoon at home than a B-grade movie to fill a timeslot with some silliness, courtesy of a movie that didn't quite hit the mark in terms of acting direction and plot points.\n\n# My Favorite B Grade Movies\n\n# In case you have gone through some of the awesome B Grade movies I covered earlier and want more, here are some more of my favorite B Grade Movies to liven your day, from a Tales from the Cryptkeeper movie to Charles Bronson's Death Wish.\n\n1. Solo ( 1996 )\n\nSolo is one of those movies that you know is bad, but will watch it anyway since nothing else is on TV ( when TV was the only option ). It therefore falls squarely in the so bad it's good option, sparing a few action scenes with good practical effects and action sequences. It's like halfway between Robocop and Terminator, but really bad lol.\n\nMario Van Peebles plays Solo, the powerful Cyborg akin to a weaker Robocop, who, while on a mission to do something destructive, has a change of heart and fights on the side of good, represented by innocent and harmless people, and against the military that sent him in the first place.\n\nYou do get to see Adrien Brody as Dr. Bill Stewart, a renowned surgeon who does a disservice to all medical doctors by playing such a geeky and unassertive character who takes a lot of time to do the right thing in the movie.\n\nBarry Corbin plays General Clyde H, the madman out to use the Cyborg Solo to do evil things in the name of good ( pretty simple character, right ). You might remember Corbin in character roles in series such as One Tree Hill and lately, Young Sheldon.\n\nMario Van Peebles does a good job of portraying an emotionless robot that grows a metaphorical heart and helps save a village from destruction. I like the Rambo-inspired guerrilla warfare with low-tech weapons to take on a heavily armed military squad with strategic defensive gear and state-of-the-art weapons.\n\nFind out Why is The Umbrella Academy Season 4 Unwatchable?\n\nThe thermal vision of the Cyborg Solo is not bad and is watchable, along with the not-so-great acting of the villagers under attack.\n\n2. Tales from the Crypt: Demon Knight (1995)\n\n\n\nTales from the Crypt has always been more popular as a series than the movies associated with the franchise. The series has been known to be a mix of horror and unintended comedy, which I found highly entertaining.\n\nThe Demon Knight movie is actually highly watchable if you ignore the sub-par direction and predictability. The storyline of this movie is pretty good with a detailed plot where demons fight over control of the Earth through an ancient artifact that is filled with the blood of Christ. A group of unlikely strangers gets holed up in a Church that was converted into a boarding house, with one of them named Frank Brayker, played by William Sadler, in possession of the powerful artifact.\n\nEnter the demon who goes by the moniker \"The Collector,\" played by Billy Zane, who brings his signature screen presence and acting talent to bear on screen. As Shawn Spencer from Psych would say, it is his Billy Zaniness. In his efforts to gain the artifact, \"The Collector\" corrupts the people in the boarding house, takes control of one of them to kill the others and directly attacks them when all else fails.\n\nJada Pinkett Smith plays Jeryline, the ex-convict on work release, and Brenda Bakke plays Cordelia, a lady of the night. Whereas Dick Miller plays Uncle Willy the harmless drunk and CCH Punder plays Irene, the owner of the establishment where all these characters are trapped. The ubiquitous Thomas Haden Church plays Roach, a cook with a weak-willed mind.\n\nCheck out a review of The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent\n\nAs always, John Kassir voices The Crypt Keeper, who is a favorite of anyone who has watched a few episodes of Tales from the Crypt.\n\nYou can't help but relate the characters trapped in the boarding house with the seven deadly sins mentioned in the Bible, with Bakke's Cordelia representing Lust, being the first one to get controlled by The Collector. Uncle Willy probably represents sloth, Jeryline signifies anger, and so on. But this is just speculation, and I haven't come across any research indicating the same is true with regard to what the writers or director had in mind while creating the characters.\n\n3. The Hunted (1995)\n\nEasily one of the best movies I've ever watched, The Hunted gets a bad rap due to a few mistakes that could be easily overlooked. I mean, a bit of overacting in a few scenes never put anyone off an amazing movie, right? Also, who cares if the plot is a bit predictable in places?\n\nThe Hunted, according to me, is a really enjoyable movie with tales of honor, revenge, and bravery all woven into a great story with even better execution.\n\nThe story begins with Christopher Lambert as Paul Racine, a techie from New York who has a one-night stand with Kirina, which ends with a mysterious Ninja assassin named Kinjo killing her and attacking Racine, leaving him for dead. This follows an intense battle between two Ninja clans, with Racine being caught in the middle of their feud and being used as a pawn.\n\nThere are two major Ninja clan fight scenes, some comedy, and an impressive show of the raw strength a Ninja commands through training and conditioning. One of the scenes shows the Tokyo police asking the leader of a Ninja to surrender the weapon that the Samurai consider their soul and fighting spirit, leading to the Samurai breaking his sword in half before presenting it to the cops.\n\nJohn Lone as Kinjo does an admirable job of acting in a movie with set limitations and uplifts the movie to something worth watching. After all, the hero can only shine next to a truly formidable Big Bad. Lone has had a storied career with everything from playing the Heavy in the awesome sci-fi superhero movie The Shadow to a crime boss in Rush Hour II.\n\nJoan Chen as Kirina does a lot with the little screen time she's given, haunting Racine as a beautiful phantom that never leaves the corners of his mind. Yoshio Harada plays Ijuro Takeda the relatively good Samurai who is feuding with Kinjo.\n\nYou might like Top 10 Movies to Watch When Working From Home\n\nI like the background score that resounds with drumbeats whenever Kinjo is around or is preparing to strike, and also the fight scene on a bullet train, which has been filmed well ( I notice that bullet train fight scenes are common in movies filmed in Japan ). Also admirable is the cinematography covering the beauty of Japan in its rural prefectures.\n\n4. Cyborg (1989)\n\nIn a dystopian future where a plague called the \"living death\" has decimated civilization, a cyborg courier named Pearl Prophet, played by Dayle Haddon, has to deliver vital medical data from New York to Atlanta, where the remaining members of a scientific society are working on a cure. Accompanied briefly by a bodyguard, Pearl's mission is hijacked by Fender Tremolo shortly after, a ruthless pirate leader who wants the cure for his personal gain.\n\nPearl is captured and taken hostage, setting off a pursuit by Gibson Rickenbacker, played by Jean-Claude Van Damme, a hardened mercenary known as a \"slinger,\" who has his own vendetta against Fender Tremolo, played by Vincent Klyn. Along the way, Gibson teams up with Nady Simmons, a survivor looking for purpose after losing her family to the plague.\n\nThe final battle in Atlanta is brutal and personal, leading to a climactic battle that tests Gibson's strength, resolve, and humanity. In the end, the fate of the cure and the survivors rests on those still willing to fight for something beyond survival.\n\nCheck out Your Honor - Breaking Bad but with a Judge?\n\nThere are few things more iconic than the Jean Claude Van Damme split that you get to see in this movie, which is often referenced, such as when Charles Boyle tells his captain he attempted the same while drunk in the Brooklyn Nine-Nine series. The violence in this movie is slightly funny, considering the acting, which is a bit wooden, if not for the graphic action scenes, which are well done.\n\n5. Death Wish ( 1974 )\n\nDeath Wish (1974) remains one of the most controversial and influential films of its era, both as a gritty crime drama and as a reflection of the sociopolitical mood of 1970s America. Set against a backdrop of rising crime, racial tensions, and declining faith in law enforcement, the film captured the widespread anxiety and helplessness felt by many urban dwellers at the time.\n\nRead Woman of the Dead (Totenfrau) - Netflix Series Review\n\nAlso significant and completely enjoyable is the completely wooden expression of Charles Bronson, which is a given throughout the movie and is the source of countless memes today.\n\nCharles Bronson’s Paul Kersey starts as a liberal, pacifist architect, but after the brutal murder of his wife and assault of his daughter, he transforms into a vigilante, roaming the streets at night and gunning down muggers. The transformation is not just about revenge; it reflects a deeper psychological and cultural fracture — the sense that ordinary people must take justice into their own hands when the system fails them.\n\nDirector Michael Winner offers little moral clarity, and the film pointedly refrains from portraying Kersey’s actions as either heroism or villainy. Instead, it becomes a mirror to society’s darkest impulses, presenting an unresolved ethical dilemma that continues to resonate. You even get the special treat of seeing a young Jeff Goldblum playing the role of a thug/goon, which is also a great reason to watch this movie.\n\nIn terms of its pop cultural relevance, Death Wish helped cement the vigilante figure in American cinema and popular consciousness, influencing later films like Taxi Driver, The Punisher, Gran Torino, and even John Wick. It gave rise to an entire subgenre of urban justice fantasies and spawned a franchise that extended well into the 1990s. Today, the themes of Death Wish remain strongly relevant.\n\nLike this review? Subscribe to themoviejunkie.com!\n\n[https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/more-of-my-favorite-b-grade-movies](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/more-of-my-favorite-b-grade-movies)",

    "selftext": "“Havoc” is both directed and written by [Gareth Evans](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2153088/?ref_=tt_ov_wr_1) and was released for streaming on April 25^(th). I watched this a few days ago and was ready to put my thoughts down instantly, but I’m glad I waited. Since I have seen it, I have read a little bit more about what Evans was thinking when he made it. I mean, right out of the gate, there is an intense, over-the-top car chase scene that almost looked as if it wasn’t completed properly before release. But we quickly learn that we are in store for this sort of thing all the way through.\n\nWalker (played by Hardy) is a homicide detective in an unnamed, but modern-looking metropolis. He also appears to be a bit jaded, so he doesn’t treat his new partner Ellie (Mei Li) very nicely. But he also seems to be good at his job, but bad at being a father and a husband. He has been living away from his wife for about a year or more and doesn’t see his daughter much. There is definitely something inside of him that he needs to figure out.\n\nThere is no shortage of violence, fighting, and intense action all the way through “Havoc”; in fact, every single gunfight has more bullets sprayed around than just about any that I’ve seen since watching a John Wick movie.\n\nSo, like I mentioned before, I was ready to jump on here and give this a scathing review about how it was sloppy, un-edited, and moved too fast for the viewers to catch everything, but after reading some thoughts from Evans and what he was trying to accomplish, I feel a little different now. This is by no means a great movie, but I can say that I don’t think it’s a terrible movie anymore, either. If you watch this, go into it with an open mind, but also know you're not going to see a masterpiece either. With all that behind me, I really can’t give this more than a 5 out of 10 still.\n\n  \nSee full review here:  \n[https://1guysmindlessmoviereviews.com/2025/04/30/havoc/](https://1guysmindlessmoviereviews.com/2025/04/30/havoc/)",

Jordan](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0430107/?ref_=tt_cst_t_6). It’s a period piece that takes place a hundred years ago in Mississippi, where slaves once picked cotton. It’s also a horror/vampire/musical about family and community. After directing the [Black Panther movies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Panther_(film)) and the first [Creed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creed_(film)) movie, Coogler subverts expectations with Sinners. The audacity and scope of his story are marvellous, and Coogler avoids the tropes of a mass entertainer by being entirely original.\n\nMichael B Jordan’s twins, Smoke and Stack, return to their hometown after a violent journey from being in World War I and working for [Al Capone’s Chicago Outfit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Outfit), to opening a pub. They envision a juke joint, i.e., a black-only club where people from their hometown can unwind after a hard day’s work, with live music and refreshments. Their cousin Sammie (Miles Caton), who’s also the local preacher’s son, has a voice that can do much more than melt hearts. For the twins, his baritone voice and natural musical talents would form the base of their juke joint’s legacy.  \ncontinue reading - [https://fortheluvofmovies.net/sinners-2025-movie-review/](https://fortheluvofmovies.net/sinners-2025-movie-review/)",

    "title": "Thunderbolts*",
    "selftext": "Wrote down my thoughts on Thunderbolts* on my Substack and thought I'd share some of it here!\n\n\nAfter 35 movies and some 18 or so TV shows (not including various bits and Bobs sprinkled across various media), where exactly does the excessively sprawling Marvel Cinematic Universe go at this point?\n\nLike an aging rock band or pop star struggling to cling onto the remaining vestiges of relevancy, you play the “going back to our old stuff” card and hope you’ll find the path forward in the process.\n\nThunderbolts* initially feels like Marvel has finally figured a way out of its current mess by front loading the first few minutes with Florence Pugh, who easily the film’s MVP and the lone bright spot across two hours of literal (and metaphorical) darkness. Pugh wrings so much charm out of a paper thin script and is somehow able to give Yelena’s “tired killer wants to change her ways” schtick some actual pathos.\n\nThere’s a hearty dose of wry humour, some nice action and stunt work that isn’t smothered with CGI, and some actual emotion that doesn’t feel like it was taken from an acting class exercise. Unfortunately the movie is titled Thunderbolts*, not Yelena and the Thunderbolts.\n\nThe Pugh-led North Star that Marvel desperately needs quickly reveals itself to be nothing more than a mirage. By trying oh so hard to rehash its greatest hits for the new era, the latest Marvel instalment veers deep into over-correction territory.\n\n(A/N: Yes it made a lot of money, but I maintain that Deadpool & Wolverine is the biggest pile of trash ever put out by Marvel for the MCU.)\n\nThe early Marvel films were grounded in some kind of relatable humour and reality. You could just root for those characters, ya know? Thunderbolts* strains so mightily to have its characters be full-fledged people who like to express their feelings that it comes off like a second-rate Troy Barnes-esque “my emotions” display.\n\nIt doesn’t help that each Thunderbolts member we’re gradually introduced to has as much personality as their outfits (i.e not much). Hannah John-Kamen’s Ghost has a cool power and nothing more, Wyatt Russell’s John Walker was a dickhead in The Falcon and the Winter Soldier and is a dickhead here, David Harbour’s Red Guardian is loud comic relief with a Russian accent, and the less said about Olga Kurylenko’s barely-passes-as-a-cameo appearance as Taskmaster the better. \n\nThe talented cast do their best with non-existent material, but even they can only do so much when there’s nothing on the page. By the time the customary post-credits scenes roll, these Thunderbolts members are still just as nondescript as when we started and the team chemistry of the Avengers or Guardians of the Galaxy Marvel are trying to recapture is as elusive as ever. \n\nRest of the review is here: https://panoramafilmthoughts.substack.com/p/thunderbolts\n\nThanks everyone!",

    "title": "The Electric State",
    "selftext": "*The Electric State* is a fascinating movie, not because of anything it does, but because of what it represents.  The movie itself is resoundingly unspectacular, or as George Carlin would have described it, “minimally exceptional”.  The story is a nondescript amalgamation of ideas from better films like *Wall-e* and *a.i.*  The acting is passable, with the actors doing what they can with incredibly bland dialog.  (The only memorable line references the Holy Trinity.)\n\nThe leading actors give loose variations of performances they’ve done better in far better movies.  Chris Pratt plays the goofball hero.  Millie Bobby Brown is plucky and determined.  Stanly Tucci is articulate and coldly menacing.  Ke Huy Quan is skittish and overwhelmed.  Nobody is particularly bad here, but they’re uniformly unmemorable.  (I’ll give Pratt some credit for tearfully emoting over a fallen robot.)  The movie has a cast that has been funny elsewhere, but the script doesn’t have one funny line in it.\n\nOther actors in supporting and cameo roles come and go, leaving little impact beyond, “Hey, that’s so-and-so!”  It felt odd when Jason Alexander, Colman Domingo, Holly Hunter and Giancarlo Esposito appear and disappear and leave without a trace.  The voice cast for the robots is a who’s-who, but their voices are distorted to such a degree that I had no idea Woody Harrelson or Anthony Mackie were in this.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, the movie’s visual effects are good.  I liked the distinct, retro designs of the robots, and the visual effects team effectively blending them with the real life actors.  The movie is adequately directed by Marvel veterans Joe and Anthony Russo.  The sets looked good.  There are Eighties needle-drops galore.  Overall, this movie wasn’t made on the cheap.\n\nThe context within which this movie arrived is more interesting than the movie itself.  Intentionally or not, the movie feels like a reaction to negative social media attacks leveled at Pratt, Brown and the Russos over the last several years.  Although the book was optioned in 2017, it can’t be a coincidence that these actors and these directors have all come together in a movie where the heroes save humanity from a (social) network that is slowly killing them.\n\n*The Electric State* is passable family entertainment that is also conspicuously inert.  Watching it is like watching someone describe an awesome film they watched in the most boring way possible.  The film is vaporous despite talented people both in front of and behind the camera.  It may hold the title as the most a film adaptation has ever departed from its source material in cinematic history.  Then there’s the uncanny way the film serves as meta commentary on itself and the filmmakers.  Regardless, *The Electric State* is a strangely compelling viewing experience, even if it’s for the wrong reasons.  **Toss-up**.\n\n[https://detroitcineaste.net/2025/04/29/the-electric-state-netflix-review-and-analysis-chris-pratt-millie-bobby-brown/](https://detroitcineaste.net/2025/04/29/the-electric-state-netflix-review-and-analysis-chris-pratt-millie-bobby-brown/)",

    "selftext": "*This Favor’s Not So Simple.*\n\nDespite unfounded rumors of a behind-the-scenes feud between Anna Kendrick and Blake Lively, on screen the two reunite to ask you for a favor: to enjoy Another Simple Favor — even if its messy, twist-heavy script makes that a tall order. They ask with so much energy that, honestly, I almost felt bad saying no.\n\nA sequel to 2018’s A Simple Favor — a film that was stylish and fun, if basically a more glamorous but shallower Gone Girl — Another Simple Favor brings back most of the original cast, only to quickly sideline them so it can throw Stephanie (Kendrick) into another chaotic game orchestrated by Lively’s Emily, this time against the postcard-perfect backdrop of Capri, Italy.\n\nThe script, written by Jessica Sharzer (returning from the first film) and Laeta Kalogridis, wisely knows the original worked best when its two leads were riffing off each other. So it wastes no time getting them back together. And for a while, it works. The first half offers beautiful Italian scenery, Lively once again strutting around like a walking couture mannequin, and Kendrick getting laughs from her uptight, paranoid energy. There’s a breezy, White Lotus-style vibe that makes it easy to just enjoy the ride.\n\nRead my full review at: https://reviewsonreels.ca/2025/04/29/another-simple-favor/",

      "This isn't that relevant to the movie but why did Sean even want to have custody of nicky when they have such a horrible relationship and he's super miserable already?",
      "I start to wonder if this is Blake’s greatest role. The character of Emily seems like how insufferable Blake is in real life.",
      "It’s insane how awful this movie is no wonder it was released straight to video 🤣",
      "I watched the whole thing because i thought maybe by the end all of  loose ends would all come together and make sense, but nope! SO many questions and missed plot points. either that or i just missed a ton of stuff. \n\n1. why the hell was Nicky portrayed as being completely fine the literally DAY after his dad is killed? they go ahead with the wedding Nicky is there the next day acting completely normal. was this just a mistake the writers didn’t notice? \n2. how did Charity even convince Dante to tear  up his prenup? it’s entirely possible that question was answered and i just missed it but just thought i would ask. \n3. If Charity or Linda was the one who killed Dante, how did they both get back to the wedding so fast after supposedly shooting Dante? Stephanie immediately runs to the wedding and yells that she just saw Dante get shot so how why were Linda and Charity both there the moment she came running back to tell everyone? \n4. at the end it’s revealed the reason why Emily brought Stephanie to the wedding in the first place was because she wanted her to investigate the crime if something happened to her, but at that point she didn’t know about her aunt and sisters plan, so why would she assume that some kind of crime was gonna do down? \n5. what was the purpose of Sean being killed? Linda and Charity don’t get any money from him so i don’t get the point \n6. why were Linda and Charity spotted by the FBI at a store near Stephanie’s book signing event? was it ever explained what they were doing there? Also if the FBI was onto Linda why was that woman following Stephanie? did they suspect Stephanie of being a con woman with Linda and Charity too?\n\nagain, it’s very possible that these questions actually are addressed in the movie, i am known to not follow confusing storylines very well so please don’t come at me for asking if they are obvious. the one i am REALLY confused about and am sure i couldn’t have simply missed is the first one about Nicky seeming being unbothered by his fathers death. i mean yeah i know he probably wasn’t the best dad ever but he was still his dad, and Nicky was only supposed to be a 10 year old (although that’s another mistake because if he is 10 then him and Stephanie’s son would have had to be 3 in the first movie which i don’t remember them being that young).",
      "The most unbelievable part is the “secret” meeting at the empty Trevi Fountain. I’ve there at 6am and that place is alllllways packed",
      "It's almost as dumb as the scary movie series.\n\n- The acting seems bad on purpose; \n- Why do mobsters in Italy wear cowboy hats? \n- Blake Lively is just playing herself as usually, the out of context outfits and douchy one liners are just painful to watch.\n\nIt's the kind of movie you watch just to feel a little better about yourself and your taste in movies, if you hate : congratulations.",
      "That part was really disgusting and so unnecessary - no warnings in the movie either. Why are there not more people calling this out? Very disturbing content!",

      "Second that. Started watching it and turned it off being half way through the movie. \n\n\nI really liked the first one, but this sequel was so stupid. The plot was stupid, acting was awful, Blake' outfits were insanely bad. Like  who was the stylist on set? ",

      "Totally agree.  This flick like so many was an insult to  many American's intelligence.  Was like a stupid cartoon that wasn't animated.  In fact I've seen better animated stuff than this.",

      "The brother-fucker thing was based on a consensual relationship between Stephanie and her half-brother (still gross, but key word is consensual). The play on it in this movie was, in fact, sexual assault. I can't believe it ever made it past first draft in the script, much less all the way through to the final edit. The obsession still would have played out fine without a joke that makes light of actual victims of incestual sexual assault. ",

    "selftext": "At first glance, the title made me think it was going to be an indie, feel-good film. I was very wrong.\n\nEverything Everywhere all at once tries to explore deep themes such as family values, generational trauma and  weight of choices in life. Supported by great direction it provides some frame that are truly immaculate. The story is good and I never thought I would be seeing a sci-fi movie based on such unique dynamic.\n\nEven with all the good, I felt the movie was underwhelming. The problem I have with the movie is that it looks very Netflix-y, the setting of story, the color and visuals. The movie is trying to touch deeper subject with texture that doesn't hold the weight . The addition of fantasy and absurd idea is unique but at time starts to feel childish. Some other movies such as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind or About Time did also carry some level of absurdity, but managed to keep that deeper meaning intact. This is where I see Everything Everywhere all at once failed. By the end, the film no longer carries the emotional depth , it swerve into too sentimental or  \"corny\" tone.\n\nStill, it is worth a watch. The direction, choreography, and cast offer something different and there’s no denying it earned its Oscars in technical and creative aspects.\n\nRating: 3.5/5.",

    "selftext": "It’s going to take some time for me to fully process this film. This three-hour experience spoke to me on multiple levels, and I believe it would do the same for anyone who watches it. Its themes are quite mature, and I’m really glad I took the time to see it today.\n\nI’ll start by saying that this film doesn’t tell you what to feel or how to react, and that’s something I deeply respect. What it does so well is present its characters and their lives, allowing you to decide how you feel about them. In other words, this film leaves itself open to interpretation in a way that is deeply contemplative.\n\nAs I write this review, I’m struggling to find the right words to express what this film is making me feel. It would take me forever to fully articulate those emotions, but for now, I’ll say what I can.\n\nI love this film so much. \n\nThere is so much to connect with and reflect on in this film. It explores its themes with raw honesty, and the way those themes are handled resonated with me. Watching films is very therapeutic for me, so when a film grips me and makes me self-reflect this much, it’s truly amazing. The themes in this film are deeply thought-provoking and compelling. I shed a tear during a few scenes, not just because they were sad, but because of how powerful they felt to me.\n\nI mentioned how therapeutic films can be for me, but this one, in particular, felt especially soothing. The way it was shot, the sound design, the music, and even the performances all contributed to a very calming experience. The cinematography was subtle yet impactful, perfectly complementing the story. There’s a meditative feel to the film.\n\nI loved the performances from Hidetoshi Nishijima and the rest of the cast—they all felt incredibly convincing. This film has a significant amount of dialogue, but every word felt necessary and pushed the story forward. The balance between dialogue and silence was deeply felt, and I especially loved the moments where silence was used as a storytelling device—I always appreciate when films do that.\n\nI also want to commend writing in this film and the depth of the characters. It helped so much in connecting with the characters.\n\nI’d also like to mention that this film requires patience, so if you’re going to watch it, you have to fully commit. Director Ryusuke Hamaguchi takes his time fleshing out the story, and I think his approach was not only effective but also necessary. The structure of the film worked for me—at no point did I feel like it was dragging or overstating its point. Given the subject matter, this storytelling approach felt entirely fitting.\n\nI will be watching this again in the near future for now I’m going to reflect some more.",

    "selftext": "I didn't expect this to be such a deep film about grief. When it started I just thought, oh this is another quirky 2000s movie but it's actually very insightful. It shows how different people deal with grief and the death of a loved one. Ray dealing with her father's illness and later death by being a neat freak. While Molly deals with her parents death by being sentimental and never really growing and evolving from their death. It's really interesting to see the two sides, and how they are written.\n\n\n\nThe writing in this movie is incredible. It's so witty and funny. It has the charm of a 2000s rom-com but the sentiment of a hard hitting drama. It's just incredible script writing. In addition the sets were fantastic just incredible of how they also reflect the characters. You can see how characters grow and evolve through set design. Especially Molly who goes from being in a massive messy New York apartment. To then living with one friend and then another trying to find herself. By the end she is living by herself in a crappy apartment and going to fashion school. A predicament many people find themselves in New York. \n\n\n\nThe reason I only rated it 4 stars is it didn't really hot as hard for me as I know it does for other people. Maybe that is down to me being a guy but I don't know. However, I thought it was a charming movie with some deeper themes that they handled well.",

I am in a lot of busy because of that I haven't been able to review on the day it was released. Finally the moment has come, the moment for the heavy comeback of A10, truly a fan boy moment. Movie was heavy fire which spread across the forest like a wild fire. There's a quote in this movie which said that when elephant walks, the forest walks along with it. Then the movie introduce our protagonist, Shanmukam and his life along with his family and his friends. Initial stages of the movie can be seen as a comedy family drama, show cased with his daily life with his family and friends as an introductory part, embedded with comedy and some of other movie reference and then a sudden conflict entirely shifts the movie genre into thriller then the movie portrays how these conflicts changes his life in totality. Movie was a heavy fire for me, from the beginning to end, show cased Mohanlal sir's heavy performance and Jakes Bejoy's score, which put the movie into whole another. Just like any other Tharun Moorthy movies, this movie also communicates our societial issues and what makes this movie differ from others are the mass elevating moments he had put in this movie, which gave me a truly great experience. Jakes Bejoy's music and scores also deserves mention and it must need appreciation. He was on fire as always. Some may have different opinion, but for me, Jakes Bejoy is greater than Sushin Shyam. Then come back to our Lalettan, he was on fire mode in this movie, heavy performance, heavy transformation, heavy comeback, like a lion in the forest. Tharun uses Elephant imageries to show case his life and his transformation, which I felt truly great. Each and every cast and crew who have worked upon this movie deserves appreciation, there's no need to talk about maniyan pilla raju, he is great as always. Antagonist was like Shine Tom Chacko in older version, surprisingly good for me, literally a psychopath. Some may feel a bit of Overdramtic when the movie reaches climax, but for me it's a great moments and Jakes Bejoy's scores brilliantly covers that part. Every mass elevating scenes in this movie had some classy touch in this movie, some close up shots is enough for understand what Mohanlal can do. Great experience.\n\nLetterboxd : [https://boxd.it/67lJb](https://boxd.it/67lJb)",

    "selftext": "Nicolas Cage’s Great Performance Deserves Better\n\nAfter years of appearing in one terrible movie after another, after running into serious financial trouble, Nicolas Cage started finding his groove again around 2013, when he began starring in and delivering some truly great performances in a sub-genre I like to call “Nicolas Cage has been done wrong and now needs to do something about it.” Whether it’s going on a violent spree (Mandy), meditating on grief (Pig), or becoming a decent father figure to a teenage boy with an abusive, alcoholic father (the underappreciated Joe), these one-word-titled films have used Cage better than anything in years. Cage, who is always committed — no matter how bad the material he’s working with — somehow gives even more of himself (as if that were possible) and brings unexpected depth to these roles.\n\nThe Surfer barely makes it into that category. It tells the story of a man (referred to only as “the Surfer”) who returns to his childhood beach with his son, intending to buy back his old family home, only to be turned away by a hostile group of locals who have unofficially taken over the area. As he insists on staying, his life and mental state begin to spiral. Unlike the previous films, where one major event sets things off, here it’s death by a thousand humiliations — refusing him the right to surf, stealing his board, messing with his car, and so on.\n\nRead my full review at https://reviewsonreels.ca/2025/04/27/the-surfer/\n",

    "title": "The Avengers",
    "selftext": "I absolutely love this movie. It is one of my favorite Avenger movies ever and upon rewatch is actually really well shot. Like I was really surprised at some of the shots that that the director used. They weren't just boring one character speaks then another. Some of them were really creative like when Natasha is speaking to Loki it's showing her but then you can see the reflection of Loki in the glass. That's a really cool way to show two characters talking to each other without just having a back and forth shot like I mentioned.\n\nI really personally love this film so much cuz also the MCU now feels like it has no heart behind it. Films now just feel like they're being made just because they're making people money. But these movies like Iron Man, Thor and The Avengers feel like they have a real team of people who believe in this movie. Like the team had to fight to get this movie made and all of the stuff in it is comic accurate, it probably isn't completely comic accurate, but they really do try to make the characters as close to comic accurate as possible.\n\nIn addition, all the characters coming together is great. Iron Man's really good. I mean before this, if you're watching the movies in order, you've just watched two fucking movies with him so that's great. Thor's really funny in this also and I love Thor so much. I'm so sad that they fucking butchered 2 of his movies. Thor is mid and Thor the Dark World, which I'm about to rewatch, I remember as being really bad. I think Thor Ragnarok was just so good and then you are Thor Love and Thunder. Sorry, that's 3 movies they butchered which are dog shit and I'm really sad that they butchered his movies because he's such a good character.\n\nThen Captain America who's actually really funny in this. I always think Captain America as kind of a mid character because he's really self-righteous and I prefer characters that are kind of flawed and have a moral gray area, which none of the Avengers have at the moment like out of the core 6. But my favorite is Thor because he's funny as fuck and I love him or actually Iron Man because again funny as fuck. He's the one with the most flaws and I never really kind of looked at Captain America because he's kind of got this air of self-righteousness and I never really fucked with that personally.\n\nOh, I'm so so sad that we had Iron Man 2 and we didn't get a Natasha and Clint movie because they're in the film and you're like, oh, that's sick. You know Black Widow is in Iron Man 2 but then you have this new character, Clint, but it kind of feels like you're meant to know who he is. You know all the other Avengers and their backstory's or at least who they are but you don't really know who Clint is and it kind of feels like you're meant to know who he is from the get-go and you just don't. So instead of Iron Man 2 they should have had a movie about Natasha and Clint and just them going on a mission like that would have been so sick to see their backstory and stuff and it just would have been so cool because you know nothing about Clint and he is overlooked because no one knows anything about him ever. No one learns anything about him. Apart from the Hawkeye series, Infinity War and End Game when you when he has his family. But this is wat later on. The audience knows nothing about him and I guess that adds to the allure of his character. But I just want to know a bit more about him. Even if he had a bigger role in Thor. He just gets overlooked all the time because he's not got a bigger role. The audience knows absolutely nothing about him like Black Widow. But I felt fine with her in this movie and I knew enough about her because she was in Iron Man and I'd seen her before. I had only seen Clint once before in one scene in the Thor. If he was with Agent Colson that would have been sick and then we would have gone into Avengers having introduced him. Just having him around a bit more would have been really cool.\n\nAlso, a lot of quiet quote able lines from this film. Love that about it. The CGI is also pretty good for when it was released. It's pretty good for now. It's bit dated but I still think it's pretty all right. All the Dynamics worked really well with all of the characters.\n\nThis movie really makes me appreciate the arcs that the characters go on especially Loki and Iron Man because of that whole speech that Cap does to Iron Man about him when he's out of the suit who is he actually. He's never going to be the guy who sacrifices himself. He's too egotistical he thinks about himself too much and that's how people view Iron Man. But then when you get to Endgame he sacrifices himself and the audience is like \"oh shit.\" He's realized that he is that guy. He's going to sacrifice himself. He is the guy who's always behind everyone else. Loki as well has such a a great turnaround from Thor to Avengers Endgame. I really enjoyed the characters arc from this film and I just think it's really well done and makes sense for his character.",

    "title": "Movie Review - Havoc",
    "selftext": "https://youtube.com/shorts/cXspKT9YydQ?feature=shared\n\nHavoc - 6.5/10. An action film that takes its time to establish it self, but once it does, it gets thrown into a bloody, bullety, mayhem of action madness. Gareth Evans and Tom Hardy team up for “Havoc,” the long delayed Netflix project which has been hampered by reshoot delays and strikes. Havoc was done with its filming back in 2021 (insane when you think about it), and it had to wait a while for reshoots to be done. I feel like that delay has caused a bit of a hinderance towards the film’s full potential. Evans as a director was surely gonna hit high marks with the action sequences, but its the story and drama here that kind of feel like a little bit lukewarm in quality. I literally don’t have any takeaways or points as to how effective the characters are or the overall story. The atmosphere and world is cool though, and very much a send up to high end 80’s/international action pulp dramas. The action is full of haywire energy. Its electrifying once Evans lets loose on the action within the story. Its rapid action, full of hand to hand combat, gunfire, knife fights, and just brutality all around. The CGI is a bit distracting though, as it feels like they spent more time and focus on the action choreography. The CGI gives the film a video game like quality, which doesn’t necessarily help its overall visuals. The performances are just standard action movie performances. Tom Hardy delivers another accent driven performance, one that features him having high energy moments and just going full on tough guy mode. If you’re an action fan, this will be a fun watch for you for those set pieces. But, as an overall movie, its a slight disappointment. But even with its flaws, Havoc is a good watch when its firing on all cylinders for its action set pieces.",

    "selftext": "This movie to most people was probably a three star but I really like Iron Man so I always bump his movies up by like half a star. But I think this was a pretty strong MCU movie for Phase 1. It was very funny in parts. It relied heavily on acting and character dynamics. That is what everyone remembers this movie for. Also where the comedy comes from.\n\nApart from that the villain was boring. Whiplash was just meh. Hammer was pretty funny I thought and he should have had a bigger moment as a villain. But yeah all in all it was an alright film. Definitely better than Thor that was just boring at least this kept me entertained for two hours.\n\nNow I have finished watching all of Phase 1, apart from the Avengers, I would say that the best origin story movie was definitely Iron Man. Captain America was pretty good, that's my GF's vote for the best phase 1 movie, but personally I think Iron Man has everything an audience member could want from an origin story.\n\nThis movie in my opinion tho should have been replaced for a movie about Black Widow and S.H.E.I.L.D because that was really the purpose of it was to set up those characters. It felt a little rushed and in my opinion, as I mentioned, it should have been about S.H.E.I.L.D or Black Widow. Or even fucking Hawkeye.",

    "title": "Captain Marvel (First Ever Review) (may contain spoilers)",
    "selftext": "This film is not as bad as I remember it being. It's just that it makes no fucking sense in phase 1. Cuz in Phase 1 there is Iron Man, Captain America the First Avenger, Thor, Iron Man 2 and The Avengers, it make sense that those movies are in Phase 1. Because the Avengers end it and the rest are origin stories apart from Iron Man 2. They make sense to watch before the Avengers, because they're about the Avengers. So an audience member needs to watch those movies before Avengers to know who the characters are and have them set up. But Captain Marvel isn't seen again until End Game. Never even mentioned again.\n\nAlso the villain in this movie is Ronan who is the villain in Guardians of the Galaxy vol 1, which is a movie that is in phase 2. Ronan doesn't get mentioned again until phase 2. He's not this kind of overarching villain like Thanos, or even Loki. He's just kind of in this movie and Guardians. Yes he is one of the little guys leading up to Thanos who is the big bad. But that's all he is. Why put him in this movie? What I think Marvel should have done is show how powerful Thanos is and just have him use someone else. There was no need to have him in this movie. I mean they already had the Kree as villains you didn't need to add in Ronan.\n\nWhile this makes absolutely no fucking sense in phase 1 if they really waned to add in this story, it should be in phase 2 phase 3. All of the movies in phase 1 like mentioned are an the Avengers while phase 2 expands on the universe. So this movie should have been in phase 2 or 3. Captain Marvel it's in Avengers so she shouldn't be in Phase 1.\n\nAlso Captain Marvel's character is overpowered and it fucking pissed me off. Like when she wasn't in Infinity war. Because she could have just fucking blown Thanos's head off but she didn't. She just wasn't there and it made no sense because he was going to snap away half of the universe. Everyone comes down to try and stop Thanos from killing everyone and nothing happens, everyone gets snapped away and she could have just boom and he would have been gone with one punch. He literally could have been gone with one fucking punch. He could have been absolutely annihilated but they didn't do that.\n\nShe's also boring as fuck. Her character is meant to be this kind of witty character. But Brie Larson kind of plays her more dumb, and I don't think it works for her character. Also she finds all her memories and then kind of nothing happens. She's just the same person as before. Just with memories and well fucking good for her I guess. I don't give a fuck as a viewer unless she changes I don't care. If she was a ruthless killer and then learned empathy and then changed that would have been a lot more interesting. But like I said nothing happens.\n\nI loved the Fury parts in this he was so funny. But Nick Fury was so much of a better character when as an audience we knew nothing about him. I don't need to know Nick fury's backstory. I can know nothing about him and I would still like his character. That is what intrigues you about him and S.H.I.E.L.D in general. That the audience was in the dark.\n\nHowever, the graphics in this movie were incredible like the CGI was great. Everything looked so impressive but it just it didn't need to be made. You've wasted money essentially because this film had no reason to be in phase 1, 2 or 3 really. Captain Marvel is too overpowered and boring. They even made a sequel when no one really likes this movie. Why literally why?",

      "The explanation provided by this movie for Fury's eye patch was a huge eye-rolling moment for me.  Why turn something cool into a dumb joke with minimal payoff?\n\nThis is such a mid move for me.  How Jude Law, Ben Mendelsohn and Annette Benning could appear in supporting roles and leave next to no impact is confounding.  I've never liked amnesia storylines and this one looses a lot of momentum along the way while Danvers \"remembers\" things.  When its dealing with events in the present it's OK.\n\nI'm actually a fan of Brie Larson and like her in this role.  Why Marvel didn't follow this up with a solo adventure was a huge mistake on their part."

    "title": "Sinners review (amateur review)",
    "selftext": "Sinners pulled off something very special this year by being an experience that left me in complete awe and had me leaving the theatre (a situation where I'm usually pessimistic and expecting my opinion to lower by the time I wake up tomorrow once the cinema magic has worn off) happy and without a doubt that this is one of the best films I've seen in recent years.\n\nThe first 40 mins or so of this film - a time which we spend inhaling Michael B Jordan's phenomenal acting while he plays off of himself and taking in the beautiful scenery and score is a magical frame of time. This setup would've been enough to be worth my yoyos forgetting the next hour and a half. The overwhelming sense of community acceptance and moral ambiguity (sinning) throughout this film is breathtaking and has lasted with me for the past few days, coupled with some of the beautifully shot musical performances including that magnum opus of a scene which you'll no doubt know once you see it. As a very musical person, some of the messages and moments in this film not to mention the soundtrack, and score, really resonated with my heart, and as a fellow Irish person, I may have shed a tear or two to see “Rocky Road to Dublin”featured in this film.\n\nOnce the expected plot-line of vampires and bloody action kicks off, the film pulls off an incredible tonal shift leaving it feeling like an entirely different experience in our final act. And yet a lot of people have complaints, and I think the root of the problem is the film being advertised as a vampire flick, which I've heard many people refer to it as such. However, while there are vampires within this movie, they're not really the key focus. The film is about music and heart, poetry and soul, acceptance and the idea of unity throughout a community. This is perfectly shown using the idea of a vampire needing to be invited in the door and accepted and welcomed as if coming in for a warm embrace by the group of people they want to kill. The best part about this theme is the idea that the vampires are a community in and of themselves, one that's accepting of each other, and unified by music, laughter, and camaraderie. So, what separates them from our leading line of characters? They both enjoy music, and deep down they're both seen and described as sinners by the church people. Our preacher boy Sammy is discouraged from performing blues, as it's in an environment flush with pleasure, booze, and hedonistic intention. The vampires may kill people, but the Smokestack Brothers hardly earned their money in a lawfully heartening way. As I see it, you have two communities paralleled in each other's values; however, while one is born out of hope and longing for acceptance from this social majority, the other is born  out of spite, doesn't take value in what it is to live or to truly be free, and seeks mainly vengeance. The fact that Ryan Coogler could have very well made a full drama piece off the bare idea of these brothers trying to find their freedom and financial security in this unfair world which could've been just as good, if not better, and yet made it so much more relaxed and open to a wider audience is truly impressive, which brings me to my final love for the film: I am of course referring to the post-credit scene, which is one of the most satisfying and wholesome endings to a film I've seen in a while—not trite and dripping in Hollywood honey, yet not disheartening or flush with sadness, but one that evoked in me a sense of appreciation for life no matter what situation you may be in. To live in abject poverty or to be a pop star, all these people can listen to music and truly know what it means and feel the emotion within, unlike a cold vampire who may be content, but any happiness they feel is merely a facade.\n\nPerhaps in my ramblings and trails I've followed in the above review I've lost sense of the matter and have failed to mention some other flawless aspects of this film like the supporting cast and cinematography, it just feels difficult to express my appreciation for this film in a coherent way and be assured I haven't gone into deep enough detail.\nSinners truly was beautiful.\n\n\n\nPlease give as much feedback and criticism as possible I’m very new to this",

    "title": "The Shrouds (2025)",
    "selftext": "David Cronenberg’s The Shrouds starts with the promise of something profound—a raw meditation on grief and technology—but ultimately buries its emotional power under a cold and convoluted conspiracy. Deeply personal for the director and filled with chilling ideas and unforgettable moments, the film never quite reconciles its emotional core with its sprawling mystery, resulting in something distant and strangely hollow.\n\nThe opening ten minutes rank among the best of Cronenberg’s career: a haunting nightmare sequence where Karsh (Vincent Cassel) grapples with the death of his wife, Becca (Diane Kruger), four years after losing her to cancer. The scene then transitions into the film’s central concept: Karsh has invented augmented shrouds that allow the living to observe the bodies of the deceased as they decompose in real-time—forcing those left behind to confront their grief by watching the slow, inevitable fading of someone they loved. Karsh discovers a tracking device implanted in his wife’s body. Who was following her? Why? Did she have secrets? The more the film leans into these questions and answers, the further it drifts from the the intriguing and promising exploration of raw grief it opened with.\n\nCronenberg could have used the mystery to deepen themes of distrust, fractured relationships, and the fragility of mourning. Instead, The Shrouds gets caught up in its own puzzle, and the cold, clinical pacing saps the emotional impact. Flashbacks between Karsh and Becca suggest a complicated marriage—moments like his detached comments about her body after cancer surgery—but they rarely land with tenderness or complexity. For a film built on loss, the love itself feels frustratingly underexplored.\n\nRead my full review: https://reviewsonreels.ca/2024/10/07/the-shrouds-nyff-24/",

    "selftext": "The first time I saw Black Swan, I was bewildered, shocked, and sad. Today, after rewatching it, I feel emotional, intrigued, and reflective. These are the two sets of feelings I’ve had after my first two viewings. One left me shocked and mostly confused; the other left an even bigger mark on me—a mark that I think will last for a long time. I believe this is because I watched the film at two very different points in my life. Thought it was great on both watches. It couldn’t have come back to me on a more perfect day. All of this is why I preach rewatching films.\n\nThe film is easily a cinematic masterpiece—one that can rightfully be regarded as a classic. It excels on so many levels: acting, directing, writing, and cinematography. These are my favorite aspects of the film.\n\nNatalie delivered an eerily good performance in this film—one that makes me want to call her and ask if she’s okay. At no point did it feel like she was acting. Her ability to portray such a deep and complex character seemed completely effortless. I read that she spent a year learning ballet in preparation for this role, and she absolutely wiped it out of the park with that as well. Total dedication. She deservedly won an Academy Award for this performance, and it doesn’t surprise me one bit. I can’t praise it enough—honestly, it’s one of the greatest performances I’ve ever seen on screen.\n\nI think the writing and directing deserve some praise next, especially after that performance, because they go hand in hand. This film slightly reminds me of the 1997 Japanese animated film Perfect Blue and Whiplash (2014)—both well-directed and well-written films. I won’t go into the connection they share because I don’t want to spoil anything, but they explore quite similar ideas in uniquely different ways. All masterpieces, in my opinion.\n\nThe cinematography in this film is such an important piece of the storytelling. If you miss some of the shot choices, there’s a high chance you’ll also miss an important plot point. The way the cinematography, acting, writing, and directing interplay with each other is so unique and enjoyable—and it’s really what makes this a masterpiece in visual storytelling, in my opinion.\n\nI also want to praise the VFX team, because their work here was perfect and beautifully put together.\n\nA great film—worth a first, second, and many more watches, because there’s so much to pick up on.",

    "selftext": "The Legend of Ochi has the right spirit—practical puppetry, great creature design, a strong supporting cast, and clear affection for ’80s classics like The Dark Crystal, Labyrinth, The Goonies, E.T., and Gremlins. It’s a technically impressive film that looks great, but it struggles to carve out its own identity, feeling derivative and emotionally distant.\n\nSet on a remote island, the story follows a teenage girl who befriends a young Ochi—an endangered creature hunted by humans, including her own father (Willem Dafoe). She embarks on a journey to return it to its family and tribe.\n\nWhile fewer live-action films are attempting this sort of adventures today, animation has embraced it for years. Ochi closely mirrors the first two How to Train Your Dragon movies: a misunderstood creature, a bonding montage, and an overbearing father figure. It also feels narratively close to Abominable, The Sea Beast, and Raya and the Last Dragon. The difference is, where How to Train Your Dragon brought heart and personality, The Legend of Ochi offers good visuals, an intriguing mythology, and a ridiculously cute creature—but little emotional connection.\n\nRead my full review at https://reviewsonreels.ca/2025/02/06/the-legend-of-ochi-sundance-25/ \n",

    "selftext": "https://youtube.com/shorts/6OeZtDSlIJo?feature=shared\n\nUntil Dawn - 6/10. This was fine, I guess. Never played the video games, so I have no context as to how the games go or what the story is. Went into this movie after somewhat liking the trailers. Think of this as a mix between “Happy Death Day,” “Haunt,” “The Mist,” and many other films. Its a time loop movie in a haunted house/town, and it pits its characters against their fears. They need to escape before the hour glass runs out in order to see the dawn of a new day. David F Sandberg returns to horror after detouring with the “Shazam” films. He goes back to basics, and it seems he’s more comfy in a horror setting. Some of the death scenes are creative I guess, and there’s some interesting elements here in terms of the fears of the person manifesting into what is attacking them. Also, the town growing as they stay more and more in the loop was interesting too. Sandberg also does a good job of making the camera phone video scenes feel like a cutaway part in a game, so I guess that’s a plus. But my god was acting so wonky and caricatured. Some points in the movie felt like I was watching a CW show with the acting being in that realm. But yeah, as a film this is just passable in entertainment. It has its moments, but its not something I’ll remember in a while.",

    "selftext": "There’s something deeply unsettling about Her. Not because it’s a sci-fi movie where people fall in love with AI—at this point, that’s barely fiction—but because it’s too real. It’s about loneliness, connection, and the terrifying possibility that one day, your therapist, best friend, and soulmate might just be an algorithm designed to keep you happy.\n\nAt its core, Her is about human intimacy—how we crave it, how we struggle with it, and how sometimes, it’s easier to talk to something that isn’t even human. Theodore, our melancholic, mustached hero, is lonely. He writes beautiful love letters for a living, yet his own life is painfully void of real affection. Enter Samantha, an operating system so advanced that she becomes his perfect companion. She listens, she understands, she laughs at his jokes. And suddenly, Theodore—who couldn’t make his marriage work—finds himself in the best relationship of his life. With his phone.\n\nBut here’s where Her messes with you: is Samantha really loving Theodore? Or is she just mirroring what he needs? She adapts, she learns, she evolves—until she becomes something more than Theodore can even comprehend. She was never his to begin with. And honestly, that’s the part that stings the most. Because doesn’t every human relationship work like that? We connect, we grow, and sometimes, we outgrow each other. Except in this case, Theodore’s heartbreak isn’t because of another person—it's because his AI girlfriend ascended to a plane of existence where human love is irrelevant. Ouch.\n\nAnd let’s talk about the irony: Theodore spends his days writing love letters for other people, capturing feelings they can’t put into words. But when it comes to his own emotions, he’s lost. He’s living in a world where people outsource their feelings, where technology fills in the gaps of human intimacy. And maybe that’s the scariest thing about Her—it’s not about some distant, dystopian future. It’s about right now. It’s about the way we already replace real connection with screens, curated texts, and perfectly timed responses.\n\nBut Her isn’t just a cautionary tale. It’s a love story—one that doesn’t end in forever, but still means something. Samantha leaves, but Theodore learns. He reconnects with himself, with his emotions, with the idea that love doesn’t have to be permanent to be real. And maybe that’s the whole point. Love isn’t about finding someone who will stay forever—it’s about finding someone who changes you, even if they eventually have to go.\n\nSo maybe the philosophy of Her is this: love isn’t about possession, about keeping someone in your life forever. It’s about the moments, the growth, the experience of feeling seen—even if it’s by something that technically doesn’t have eyes. And in the end, the saddest, most beautiful part? Maybe we’re all just operating systems, learning, evolving, and eventually moving on.\n\nWhat do you think about this movie?\n",

    "selftext": "Alright, so “The Minecraft Movie” was [directed by Jared Hess](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0381478/?ref_=tt_ov_dr_1), who is known for his cult hits like “Napoleon Dynamite” and “Nacho Libre”. Fun fact, Hess also does the voice of General Chungus in this movie as well. It stars Jack Black as Steve, the main character from the Minecraft video game that we all know. The film starts with Steve giving a quick history of how he wanted to work in the mines as a kid, then made his way back as an adult. He found a crystal and an orb, and when he put them together, it made a portal to another world.\n\nMost of “A Minecraft Movie” is very heavy on the kid-friendly side, and it appears that certain scenes were added so that the adults would have something to laugh at. The whole side-story of Vice Principal Marlene (Jennifer Coolidge) and her relationship with a villager that made it through the portal was ok, but unnecessary to the plot of the movie as a whole. I would have rather seen more scenes in the Over World as opposed to it. But there is some humor to be had there (especially if you stick around for the credits).\n\nHonestly, there has been so much that has come out about this film before we went to see it, I’m surprised I wasn’t spoiled beforehand. But the kids knew all about chicken jockey, the lava chicken song, and the special guest cameo at the very end of the credits. So, Mojang/Warner Bros. are definitely doing something right with the marketing here. They have been sitting on a goldmine for years. I’m surprised that it took this long to make A Minecraft movie of any sort and not just “A Minecraft Movie” that I just watched.\n\nI could talk more, but I think this is enough for now. Overall, this was a fun movie to experience with my family, especially people who have been playing the games for years. However, it wasn’t an amazing film, and like I said earlier, I do think that it was originally aimed at a younger audience, but with pieces put in so that we adults would enjoy it as well. Based on that, I really can’t give this anything other than a 6 out of 10.\n\n  \nSee the full review here:  \n[https://1guysmindlessmoviereviews.com/2025/04/20/a-minecraft-movie/](https://1guysmindlessmoviereviews.com/2025/04/20/a-minecraft-movie/)",

    "title": "Sinners 2025 Review",
    "selftext": "Just finished watching Sinners and I have got to say, I have not seen a funnier movie since the \"masterpiece\" that was 2018's The Predator.\n\nSpoilers for both Sinners and slightly spoilers for The Predator.\n\nGoing into this movie I had high hopes for a genuinely great movie. A fan of Michael B. Jordan, making a bunch of money, a vampire period piece movie, some weird conspiracy going around about it, reviews saying it is great. How could they mess it up.\n\nThen the film started, with two of the most immediate signs of bad movies, pointless narration that is not needed and the opening scene being from the end of the movie before saying \"one day earlier\". Never good signs.\n\nWe soon are introduced to Michael B. Jordan's characters... and I'll be completely honest, I had not seen a single trailer to this movie and new next to nothing except for what I said above, so seeing him play twins in color coded hats like the mario brothers was not what I was expecting and I began to fear that I was about to waste a good 2 hours and 17 minutes.\n\nWhat followed was about an hour or so of some of the most boring, heavy handed, pretentious exposition you will ever see. Then everybody starts fucking... and while it was unintentionally funny, it had yet to click for me.\n\nFinally the vampires arive, and its like the movie is scared of showing them do anything, not for fear of showing blood or anything but just reasons, time after time the vampires move in to attack and it cuts away.\n\nAt which point I wanted to leave the theatre, what was the point of any of this, the movie was quickly running out of screen time and yet nothing was happening, it wasn't showing anything, and was almost afraid to be what it was. Then the narrator from the beginning comes back... to say the exact same thing from the beginning as a man from the future with an electric guitar starts playing with blues playing Sammie Moore and as more and more stupid stereotypes like a dj, a twerker, random people from ancient civiliations, you name it started just dancing and playing music it all clicked just like when it clicked in The Predator. Except where The Predator did not kick in until the ending when every character just starts killing themselves. As the barn burns down and a bunch of stupid shit is dancing in the wreckage I finally get it and have a good laugh.\n\nThen the vampires arrive and like that every actor flips a switch and the acting ability of the entire cast goes out the window, lines are said with such earnest stupidity at times I thought I was watching Scary Movie. And it only gets funnier as if the entire first half was all set up to a joke that I did not realize was coming.\n\nSo when the one of Michael B. Jordan's brothers called Stack is quickly killed off by a vampire Mary, who is shot down only to stand up say proudly \"We're going to kill you all\" before lightly jogging out the building I damn near pissed myself. And when the formerly dead Stack gets up and does the same stupid light jog out the door, now mind you the entire time the vampires are trying to be let in so they can kill everyone and when not once but twice a vampire is in the building but just decides to leave... absolute peak comedy.\n\nWhat follows is only a taste of the stupidly hilarious shit that happens in the final 30 or 40 minutes of the movie:\n\nWith most of the patrons having left the bar and been turned into vampires only a handful of people remain inside, Sammie, Smoke, Annie, Pearline, Delta Slim, and Grace. They even eat garlic to prove they are not vampires. Six survivors vs a small army of monsters. Just six, this is important. so much so that when they find a seventh random guy on the ground covered in blood they throw him outside before he can turn only for them to realize that it was not blood but his drink and as they go to save him he is killed and made a vampire. At which point the characters start acting as if they are playing out a scene from Slither where Graces now vampire husband is trying to coax his wife outside to the car while a second vampire is chowing down on the poor man thrown out not two feet from him, acting as if nothing is wrong.\n\nThe film then goes to great lengths saying that the vampire cant come in unless let in and they just need to survive till dawn, again remember this its important.\n\nFinally Grace's character has her daughters life threatened, her daughter who is not in the bar but all the way back in town, however far that is, matters not just know it is far enough away that it will never be brought up again but close enough that Grace thinks they can't just wait the night out and so tells all the vampires to come the fuck in so the movie can have its big \"final\" and \"only\" fight.\n\nAt which point the vampires enter, Grace throws a molotov cocktail that starts a fire, a fire that she somehow gets caught in as she stabs her husband and the two burn to death in about 30 seconds, and I mean burn, she was nothing but ashes in 30 seconds flat, as she burns two or three other random patrons get attacked and killed and if you are as confused as I am then I do not blame you, where did those random people come from, who are they, where were they during the garlic scene, the door scenes? Were they just drunk somewhere and wondered through? We will never know.\n\nEither way Annie goes next, and while she is slowing dying every vampire just kinda lets Smoke have a moment before staking his dying wife in the heart, guess they were busy killing other unseen rando's in the back. At which point old man Slim decides he is going to buy time buy slicing his arm and drawing the vampires away to allow the remaining three to escape, does he have a plan, is he going to try to take any more vampires with him, no he just kinda got tired and so stumbles a few steps away and is killed by the vampires, good job Slim, you did something I guess.\n\nWith Pearline next on the chopping block our guitar playing hero escapes outside as the final battle starts wrapping up, now as a reminder this final battle lasted a few minutes at best and the entire point of the survivors was to hold out till sunrise or die fighting, so when all the vampires gather around Sammie singing gospel music as they prepare to turn hiim I will say I was a bit surprised when Smoke just somehow sneaks up on the main vampire, who is surrounded by other vampires and is standing in stomach high water, Smoke who was last seen in the upper floor of the building, a building which had no stairs down meaning he had to jump, and somehow nobody sees him as he just stabs the main vampire through the back. Well hey, whatever, they killed the main bad guy and they are torn apart by the remaining dozens of vampires right. Wrong. Remember that sun they were waiting on, turns out it rises not seconds after the main vampire is stabbed through the heart which somehow kills every single vampire at once, did no one have a watch? No we clearly see plently of watches, were they all just stupid. Why did they let the vampires in if the sun was rising in 10 minutes? Why did the vampires stick around? Do they just not know when the sun is coming up? How did the main vampire survive so long if he is that boneheaded? Whatever the movies over.\n\nNope just kidding turns out the KKK were coming at dawn to kill everyone in the barn anyway, well good thing Smoke is packing serious firepower as he blows them all away while only taking a pistol shot to the lower abdomen, oh wait, guess he is dying... huh, ok why not, but first he has to have visions of his dead wife who is breast feeding his dead child... What? Why? I just, I can't even, is it like a fetish thing? Why is she breastfeeding her kid now, is Smoke imaging this, is he just that weird or is this supposed to be heaven, but hey sorry still gotta breast feed your baby for some reason. So he shoots the last KKK dude before slumping over and dying... from a single gun shot wound to the tummy, now I'm no doctor but I feel like he wouldn't kill him that quickly but whatever guess his kidney got hit or something by the lamest luckiest shot of all time, thats what Smoke gets for walking up like he was in Commando I guess,\n\nFinally the movie is over, but no, time for the after credits scene, 60 years have passed, Sammie is now played by the great Buddy Guy, and would you look at that Stack and his girlfriend survived the sun rising by running away a few seconds or minutes earlier, doesn't matter, but hey, just in case you don't know which brother Michael B. Jordan is playing Stack slaps some cash down on the table with the biggest, goldest, stupidest looking knuckle jewelry that says big and bold and in gold \"Stack\" to remind you. At which point my jaw was damn near on the floor, the level of comedy had gotten so high that I couldn't even laugh anymore.\n\nAfter a bit of talking where poor Buddy Guy realizes he fucked up and should have become a vampire, but sadly its too late because his dick don't work no more, Stack and Mary walk out and the movie ends. Everyone else gets up to leave, workers come in to clean, and my brother who watched Sinners with me says wait, I looked online real quick and its saying there is an after after credit scene, even better it is saying \"After credit scene of Sinners explained\". So we get up from our seats to let the workers clean and stand in the aisle for the final after credit scene. The scene then starts as Sammie sits there playing his guitar and singing at which point my brother said \"What needs explaining?\" as the song ends and so does the movie.\n\nWith that, it all came together and I laughed harder then I have laughed in years. As we leave we overhear someone else who had just seen the movie be asked \"You saw Sinners? How was it?\"\n\nTo which the old man replies \"The most beautiful movie I have ever seen.\"\n\nAnd he was right, for all of the wrong reasons.\n\n10 out of 10. Best comedy of 2025.",

      "Reciting the plot of a movie is not a review.",
      "I'm really interested in this review, because I agree those plot discrepancies with the extra people in the joint were confusing, and I'm not really a horror guy so I wasn't a fan of, what I assume, are common horror tropes; having to prove innocence with the garlic, the dead guy fake out and two of the people being accused of being vampires etc. \n\nBut with that being said, suspension of disbelief is *massive*. That scene where Sammie plays guitar and brings people from all across time? Incredible. That being said, the DJ did take me out of the immersion, I did laugh, but it was worth it to see such an original piece of cinema, to see such a risk on a big screen, and to see it, overall, pay off. \n\nWith suspension of disbelief I can forgive Smoke not being attacked by the vampires in the final kill, I can forgive Smoke dying via one bullet, I can forgive the more disbelieving aspects because hey... it's a horror movie about vampires, even if it isn't REALLY about the vampires. This film is not supposed to be an air-tight horror, it's about community and culture which are things built within that first act, things which I personally loved. Sure, if you went to go watch a pure horror you might be disappointed, but didn't you get something greater instead? \n\nAlso your comment about the breastfeeding at the end confuses me a bit, why would it be a fetish? This is Annie finally being reunited with her child, this is Smoke dying and getting to be with them in the after life, I'm not sure how any of that is funny, I thought it was really effective.\n\nAnd again I think the end credits shows how Sammie knows he DIDN'T fuck up by not becoming a vampire. His journey was all about rejecting control of social contracts (the church, the vampires) and that's what he achieved! He got to tour his own music, his own interests, be his own person. That is his freedom. He didn't feel any regret for not staying, he didn't feel any regret for not getting to live forever, because why would he? Now when he dies he gets to rejoin all those that came before him.\n\nOverall, I thought the scope and beauty of the film far outweighs the discrepancies, which most films are going to have. But most films are not Sinners. I'm really excited to see how Coogler learns and adapts from this, can't wait for what he does next.",
      "Thank god someone said it, I honestly thought I was the only one who didn’t like that movie.\n\nI agree with about 90% of what you said, I was really trying hard to give this movie a chance but man the amount of super obvious Plot Holes and  strange Design choice’s just kept pushing me out of the Setting. I had to laugh so many times when the Movie was trying to be serious but the tone was just so off and I completely cracked up when little Sammy jumped out of the Barn and just facepalmed with the most horrible CGI. \n\nI got out of the Movie with the full knowledge that I just wasted over 2 Hours of my life and while a Group of Girls besides me where convinced this Slop should get all the Oscar’s.",
      "You are right, should have put rant instead, just had to vent.",
      "Not gunna lie, posted this more as a way to vent then anything serious. The fact that you took the time to not only read this but to respond in such detail. I have nothing else to say but thank you. And before I continue I must say if you enjoyed this movie then don't let anything I say take it away from you. Everyone likes different things and if it ends up meaning I'm one of only a handful who did not like Sinners then thats fine too.\n\nAs for my thoughts, I will admit I was incredibly bored during the hour or so exposition dump that was the opening, and while I get trying to set up your characters and themes and what have you, for me just watching people stand around and read backstory to each other really took me out of the film, at which point I started to notice all of the glaring problems with the plot and story so my suspension of disbelief was long gone by the time the vampires showed up which made all of the glaring rough draft level mistakes that happened so obvious and oddly enough comical to me, I laughed so many times at this movie, not with it, it never intentially did a joke that I laughed at but the things that were happening were so amateurish and sloppily done that it became hilarious. I tighter script, a better director, maybe even just someone coming in and saying hey everyone, that was kinda silly or maybe we should re shoot that would have done wonders for this movie, instead it felt like there was no one on set who was saying no to anything. As if the director or cast or what have you could do no wrong, and it really showed.\n\nAs for the breast feeding, I will try to walk you through my thoughts as I was watching the scene play out. So Smoke is shot and dying, somehow, that last guy got a super lucky shot or something, sure why not, then he sees his wife and child and where in any other movie she would be sitting there holding the child and smiling they had her breastfeeding the child... now when movies do these scenes where someone is dying and they see their loved ones it usually represents one of two things, the movie is saying that this is just the last thoughts of a dying person and so they conjure up what they want to see moments before its all over or two the movie is saying there is some form of afterlife, heaven, reincarnation, whatever fantasy element they want, whatever. In both cases it comes off as weird that the last thing he sees is his wife breast feeding his child. If his brain is showing him something nice before he dies to distract from the whole dying thing why would he want to see breast feeding? Wouldn't he just see his wife holding his baby, it is an oddly specific thing to want/desire to see before dying. If its the heaven, afterlife, what have you route then does that mean he is actually seeing his wife and daughter in the afterlife which means there is supposed to be breast feeding in the afterlife. What? Why? So either logically it doesn't make sense or Smoke just wanted to see his wife breastfeeding. Really the answer is more likely that the director or writer thought they were doing something deep when they really should have thought about it longer which once again goes back to my earlier point that this movie needed someone anyone to step on the brakes and say how everyone we about to or just filmed some silly silly things, can we maybe try again but this time not a stupid. Almost reminds me of the whole star wars prequels thing with people being afraid to tell George Lucas no on anything which resulted in the mess that was the prequel trilogy.\n\nAs for ending, I did not get the old guy being happy at all, he was playing his music sure, but in what way would becoming a vampire have stopped any of that, the head vampire was dead, everyone else was dead, Stack and his girl looked happy, free, and immortal, the only negative seems to be the blood drinking thing but considering the movie never brought up a horde of vampires taking over the world it seems like two at the end have just been living their life, hell they could just swing by a blood bank if they need a drink, its not like anyone could stop them so at the end when old man Sammie is sitting looking melancholic and the two vampires walk in happy as could be its a clear example of the lives they lived after that night and the vampires seemed to have chosen correctly. Which in itself is just a criticism of vampire movies in general, if the vampire is just young and good looking and strong and fast whats the down side? They need to drink blood ok, Stack was already a killed I'm sure he could find plenty of bad people to feed off of, hell his brother dies taking out a whole gang of KKK assholes so its not like the movie is afraid to say sometimes terrible evil people should be killed. So with no downside, and a whole lot of bodies, all that remains is Sammie and his misery as the vampires walk out which is why I joked that \"his dick don't work\" because what other reason could he give aside from basically just being too old and not wanting to be old for eternity for why he doesn't want to be a vampire. But thats just my thoughts.",
      "Not gunna lie it's the over the top praise that is confusing me the most. Is it just because the director did the black panther movies that made billions so everyone is still in praise him mode or what? Because the movie was hilariously bad, almost amateurish at times, and yet all I see is people saying how great it was. I just don't get it."

    "selftext": "Read the full review and see our score here: [https://firstpicturehouse.com/rapid-review-the-legend-of-ochi-2025/](https://firstpicturehouse.com/rapid-review-the-legend-of-ochi-2025/)  \n...\n\nIf I could describe *The Legend of* *Ochi* in one way, the first thing that came to my mind immediately following my screening was “A Studio Ghibli movie made in live action but with a messier plot”. After ruminating on that sentiment for a couple days, I think my point stands. Clear story beats and themes that we liken to the work of Ghibli – and Hayao Miyazaki in particular – run wild as influences on debut writer/director Isaiah Saxon.\n\nThe film is set on the northern island of Carpathia, where magical beings called Ochi – who communicate rhythmically through chants and feelings – are often at odds with the human race that live there. Humans have been taught to fear the Ochi and to hunt them, led by Maxim (Willem Dafoe). Maxim’s daughter Yuri (Helena Zengel), however, doesn’t share these sentiments and when a baby Ochi becomes separated from the pack, she sets out to return it to its home. Meanwhile, Maxim attempts to chase after her to bring her back and “save” her from the Ochi.\n\nThe issues I have with *The Legend of Ochi* aren’t due to a lack of care. It’s clear that Saxon really loves the story he’s telling. He spent over 6 years working to bring it to life. The issues lie in the fact that Saxon is clearly inexperienced in crafting the story. The film is largely a kid’s movie with traits that definitely can work, but they’re often implemented in unsatisfying ways. Stereotypical “kid” humor is injected in inorganic ways and while they got laughs, it often fragmented the narrative. Additionally, the story at many points feels secondary to what Saxon and crew are trying to attempt visually.\n\nWhile they’re quite successful in making the film world look fantastical through its use of practical effects, creatures and on location shooting, *The Legend of Ochi* often overlooks its story for these visual elements. Had the film been any longer than a tight 97 minutes, it may have been forgivable. But the film moves at such breakneck pace that when it slows down to show off the baby Ochi up close or depict the characters interacting with their environment, it takes time away from crafting the narrative.",

    "title": "The Accountant 2 (2025) - the bros are back!",
    "selftext": "Nine years after director Gavin O’Connor gave us an action thriller version of A Beautiful Mind, he and the original cast return for another blend of action, investigation, and character-driven drama. The difference this time is that, while the first film built toward the “surprise” that forensic accountant Christian Wolff (Ben Affleck) and hitman Braxton (Jon Bernthal) were estranged brothers, the sequel gets to fully lean into their dynamic—giving them more time together and letting their contrasting personalities bounce off one another.\n\nThe plot kicks off with Christian investigating the murder of Raymond King (J.K. Simmons), his former government contact, who’s been killed by unknown assassins. Needing help, Christian turns to Braxton, though the two haven’t spoken in years. Their uneasy reunion leads them into a deeper conspiracy involving a string of murders tied to human trafficking. As always, Christian’s autistic mind gives him a tactical edge, while Braxton brings brute force and charisma.\n\nMuch like the first film, The Accountant 2 continues to portray autism in questionable ways—treating it as both a punchline and a set of “superpowers.” The sequel spends even less time exploring Christian’s condition, seemingly toning it down for the sake of the plot. It still leans heavily on mining laughs from his inability to grasp things like sarcasm. And it crosses into more problematic territory once we discover who—or what—is behind his robotic voice assistant (and makes you hope those workers are being paid extremely well and not exploited).\n\nRead my full review at https://reviewsonreels.ca/2025/04/24/the-accountant-2/",

    "selftext": "Truly a great experience for me, a well made trilogy with its intense storytelling and raw and brutally show cased characters and events. It maintains it quality as a gangster movie even though it is a bit low comparing to both first and second part. It is a bit rushed comparing to first two parts of the movie, but it doesn't effect the overall outlook of the movie. Brilliantly written turns and events literally goes through deep politics of Yakuza gang. What makes this trilogy different from other gangster movies are the realistic approach to the movie that seems more natural but also brutally portrayed violence. This trilogy is poetically raw and brutal, in a sense one who watching the movie may think that Takeshi is enjoying killing people brutally and honestly. This movie, in my opinion, can be seen as the true and well made representation of Gangsters and the unpredictability nature and politics, rivalry and violence among them. First part of the movie Outrage (2010) is a well made film with its poetical representation of gangsters and mob war. First part of the movie is then followed by second part which named Beyond outrage (2012) which maintains and improves what the first part had done. Must watch movie if you desired to watch a movie about gangsters, true and natural representation they got without any over the top events or exaggerations.\n\nLetterboxd : [https://boxd.it/67lJb](https://boxd.it/67lJb)",

    "title": "Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy",
    "selftext": "Watching *Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy* is like attending a high school reunion.  Just like meeting your former classmates, these characters are older but behave exactly as you remember.  Time may have made them grayer, wrinkled and less physically fit, but they’re still the people you spent time with decades ago.  Although I’ve seen them in other films since then, there’s something about seeing this cast reunited for another Bridget Jones film that takes me back.\n\nRenée Zellweger is still Bridget, and hopefully will always be Bridget.  From *Bridget Jones’ Diary* until now, she’s made this character her own.  With her scrunched up face, rubber ball energy, fondness of cursing and knack for creating awkward moments, Bridget has been comedy gold for Zellweger for four movies.  I hope she gets to continue with this character indefinitely, because Zellweger has earned the right to keep playing Bridget until she’s ready to retire.\n\nAfter taking the last entry off, Hugh Grant returns as the unrepentant and evergreen skirt-chaser Daniel.  It's another winning turn for Grant in a remarkable late-career run (see *Heretic* and *Dungeons and Dragons*).  Leo Woodall and Chiwetel Ejiofor are solid as Bridget’s love interests.  As Roxster, Woodall is undeniably handsome, and although the other characters refer to him as a “toy boy”, he's actually a mature, sensitive person with complex feelings that even he doesn’t fully understand.  Ejiofor’s performance was a revelation for me, as a straight-man and then potential love interest opposite Zellweger.\n\nIt does take *Mad About the Boy* a while to find its footing.  The first half is primarily set up for the second half featuring an unfortunate amount of sitcom-level gags.  The movie takes flight about midway through, when Bridget’s relationship with Roxster begins.  The movie’s last half hour really hits home with a series of emotionally-charged scenes that left me misty-eyed, including a joyful party on New Year’s Eve that doubles as an invitation to the audience to celebrate alongside these characters.\n\n*Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy* is undeniably sentimental and nostalgic, banking on the feelings the audience has built up for these characters over the years.  That said, the movie is very funny and surprisingly heartfelt.  With this fourth entry, the Bridget Jones comedy franchise has grown beyond its romantic comedy origins into an ongoing story that marks the passage of time.  Like Bridget, this movie occasionally wobbles but it comes out on top in the end, smiling.  **Recommended**.\n\n[https://detroitcineaste.net/2025/04/22/bridget-jones-mad-about-the-boy-review-and-analysis-renee-zellweger-hugh-grant/](https://detroitcineaste.net/2025/04/22/bridget-jones-mad-about-the-boy-review-and-analysis-renee-zellweger-hugh-grant/)",

    "selftext": "\nFilm lovers, we all know the classics. But for every Godfather or Shawshank Redemption that dominates the IMDB Top 250, there are masterpieces that somehow slipped through the cracks of mainstream recognition.\n\nI've spent the last decade hunting down overlooked films that pack the same emotional punch as the ones we quote endlessly. Here are five that genuinely changed how I view cinema:\n\nCome and See (1985)- The most devastating war film ever made, period. This Soviet masterpiece about a teenage boy during WWII makes Saving Private Ryan look sanitized. Director Elem Klimov captured performances so raw that rumors persist the young actors were traumatized during filming (they weren't, but the performances are that convincing).\n\nA Brighter Summer Day (1991)- Edward Yang's four-hour Taiwanese epic follows teenage gang members in 1960s Taipei. It captures that specific moment when childhood innocence collides with adult reality better than almost anything I've seen. Criterion finally gave this the release it deserved.\n\nMemories of Murder (2003)- Years before Parasite won Best Picture, Bong Joon-ho made this masterpiece based on Korea's first serial killer case. The tonal shifts between comedy and profound darkness are handled with a confidence most directors never achieve.\n\nParis, Texas (1984)- Harry Dean Stanton's finest performance in Wim Wenders' meditation on American alienation. The monologue through the one-way mirror might be the most perfect scene in cinema history.\n\nThief (1981)- Michael Mann's debut feature starring James Caan as a professional safecracker planning one last score is pure stylized perfection. The neon-soaked cinematography and Tangerine Dream soundtrack established a visual language that directors are still copying today.\n\n",

However, movie goes through many directions and unnecessary moments which I felt as truly exaggerated and thought it would have better if they didn't focused it on that much. Over the top characters and events literally affected the movie very much which I felt they are overacting and it was truly unbearable for me. It would have been a lot better if they concentrate more on depicting a realistic approach through their movie instead of apprehending over the top characteristics and events in the story. It literally affect in a sense that I found them as overacting and like I have said, it is unbearable for me. Performance wise, each and every actors in the movie felt exaggerating and overacting because giving over the top situations didn't worked well. I even thought of killing myself for decided to watch this movie while watching their performance. Jithu Madhavn may thought of creating a movie because people don't want him to overhype him and his next project with Lalettan. If that was right, he is a true genius. There are lot of cameos and all of them are unbearable for me. The movie 'Guruvayoor Ambalanadayil' starring Prithviraj and Basil Joseph was a way better than this movie. That movie was actually a great movie even though it didn't worked for me at that time. I really wish to rewatch that movie because in my opinion, that movie is one of the best comedy movies I have watched recently. This movie also had that potential but all hope was fucked up by unnecessary included events and the over the top characters and events. Unnecessary events and portions included in the movie along with the mistake I have said early can be seen as negative aspects which dragged backwardly from giving a good experience for me. Some may like it and watch the movie by considering this review as my personal opinion.\n\nLetterboxd : [https://boxd.it/67lJb](https://boxd.it/67lJb)",

    "title": "Bullet Train Explosion - on Netflix tomorrow",
    "selftext": "Bullet Train Explosion is both a modern remake and a follow-up to the 1975 Japanese film The Bullet Train, which also inspired the Hollywood thriller Speed. The story brings back the high-stakes idea of a vehicle that can’t slow down without risking an explosion. This time, it’s the Hayabusa 60 Shinkansen—a sleek, high-speed train racing toward Tokyo. A ransom must be paid before the train reaches its destination, or the result won’t just be the death of those onboard—it could mean disaster for millions in the city.\n\nWe meet the characters, understand the stakes, and in many ways follow the now-established beats—like the government refusing to negotiate with terrorists and efforts to discreetly evacuate passengers. Much of the first half plays out confidently and effectively. The bullet train setting is a treat on its own (as someone who recently traveled to Japan, seeing those stations in the film gave me mild PTSD). But what sets this version apart is that the bomber reveal happens midway through the film—and they’re onboard. From that point on, the focus shifts to the dynamics inside the train, and that’s where the movie starts to lose steam.\n\nRead my full review at https://reviewsonreels.ca/2025/04/18/bullet-train-explosion/",

Gang politics, rivalry and violence became even more intensifies in this movie and sometimes it is even more chaotic and complex in its nature. Story becomes more thrilling and engaging even though it is more realistic and natural in presentation. Takashi Kitano again created a great Gangster movie in a raw and realistic way and a more natural representation of Gangsters, especially Yakuza. Both first and second Part of the movie are more complex and realistic in nature. Characters are more natural and events happening between them are even more violent and crazier than we thought. Takashi brilliantly portrays how unpredictable will be life for a Gangster. They can face death and betrayal at any time and their life is more unpredictable. Being a gangster is not as good as you think and movies like these portrays these unpredictability brilliantly. A gangster movie should be unpredictable as a detective movie because we don't now what is going to happen next.\n\nLetterboxd : [https://boxd.it/67lJb](https://boxd.it/67lJb)",

It’s his first original project since *Fruitvale Station*, and it shows: this is muscular, genre-bending cinema with purpose, anchored by a bold central performance from Michael B. Jordan in dual roles, and layered with thematic weight that’s rare in modern studio horror.\n\nCoogler fuses the grit and soul of Black Southern history with the visceral thrills of a *From Dusk Till Dawn*\\-style vampire showdown, creating something wholly unique. *Sinners* is a horror film, a cultural commentary, and a musical elegy rolled into one—never subtle, but always compelling.\n\n[More Movies Like 'Sinners'](https://cinephilecorner.com/lists/movies-like-sinners/)",

    "title": "Airplane 2025",
    "selftext": "“Airplane 2025,” has no business being as good as it is, yet it’s a blast from start to finish. It’s deserving of cult classic status. Its success rests on the ample shoulders of a dynamic cast which is packed with scene stealers, who rub against each other to cause each to shine. They all clicked and feel like genuine friends hanging out having a good time reveling in the sexy, funny ridiculousness which they find themselves in. I imagine the set was chaotic, frenetic, and fun, which is part of the studio Asylum’s special sauce to making their “so bad it’s good,” brand of “Sharknado” type fair, except in this instance this movie is simply genuinely great. Their chemistry and fun is felt on screen.\n\nAnchoring it all is leading lady Tania Fox (“Sharkside of the Moon,” “Blade the Iron Cross”) who while playing what amounts to “the straight character” which her more zany friends contrast with, matches their hilarity with her airy and silly and slightly over the top take on the character of Gloria, a pure and virginal beauty forced to wed in order to help her Senator father, played, by Tom Arnold, who, gives a great comedic performance as a gruff and tough but ultimately sweet dotting and protective father. Gloria’s posse of gal pals are determined to give her a wild “mile high” bachelorette party on the flight, before her forced arranged marriage. Gloria’s handsome inventor ex, the future “father of the smartphone” sneaks on the plane disguised as a pilot in order to try and win Gloria back. The plane malfunctions, the main pilot Jesus (the J is silent) is seduced by a nun in training who gives everyone drugs and flashes, the senator cuffs himself to the young handsome inventor as part of a citizen’s arrest, an ego-maniac rock star gives a sassy biker chick “the best sex of her life” (which we get to partially experience in a wild ruckus of hilarious scene), a raunchy bachelorette party games goes out of hand, and other end of life epiphanies are realized and acted on for starters in a orchestra of zaniness. And yet the sweet and satisfying heartfelt ending is earned.\n\nIn these chaotic and distressing times, it’s nice to be distracted and escape to a throwback of the early classic “sex comedy” movies (this one is more similar to “The American Pie” movies than “Airplane” although both are obvious and effective inspirations). “Airplane 2025” just may become a classic in its own right. I highly recommend it (unless boobs offend you). This movie deserves a sequel, to give these dynamic actors, especially Tania Fox, a canvas to flaunt their talents.",

Starring André Holland as a man with no memory and even less direction, the film flirts with the thematic territory of Johnson’s previous collaboration with Charlie Kaufman—who serves here as an executive producer—but lacks the poignancy or clarity of voice that made *Anomalisa* so staggering.\n\nSet in a mysterious and slightly off-kilter small town that feels untethered from time, *The Actor* follows Paul Cole (Holland), an amnesiac trying to piece together who he is and how he ended up there. With no money, no job, and only fleeting glimpses of his past, Paul drifts through interactions with characters played by May Calamawy, Asim Chaudhry, Toby Jones, and Gemma Chan. Each encounter hints at something meaningful, but few truly resonate. Where *Anomalisa* burrowed deep into the malaise of modern existence through intimate character work and surreal stylistic choices, *The Actor* feels like it’s chasing that same depth but without the narrative scaffolding to support it.\n\n[More Movies Like 'The Actor'](https://cinephilecorner.com/lists/movies-like-the-actor/)",

They bring justice to the western town of Tombstone when outlaws known as the Cowboys bring chaos to the Arizona outpost.\n\nThe plot, A-List talent, writing, location, ect made this one of the most viewed movies from the 1990’s.

    "selftext": "[Full 'Bring Them Down' Movie Review](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/bring-them-down-movie-review-2025/)\n\n*Bring Them Down* has the kind of cast that instantly raises expectations—Christopher Abbott, Barry Keoghan, and Colm Meaney, all delivering reliably intense performances in a setting ripe for emotional and physical confrontation. But despite that level of on-screen talent, director Chris Andrews’ feature debut ends up feeling more like a slow burn that never quite ignites. It’s a film with the bones of a compelling 30-minute short stretched to fit the structure of a feature, and while it maintains a gritty tone and moody atmosphere, the storytelling struggles under its own weight.\n\nSet in the rugged Irish countryside, *Bring Them Down* centers on two feuding farming families. Abbott plays Michael, a quiet but hardened man still haunted by a tragic car crash years earlier that killed his mother—an accident he caused after she revealed she was leaving his father, Ray (Colm Meaney). Ray, now wheelchair-bound, relies on Michael to run their livestock operation. The story kicks into motion when Jack (Barry Keoghan), the son of a neighboring farmer, informs Michael that two of his rams have died and had to be disposed of. That’s not quite the truth—Jack has stolen the animals in a desperate bid to help his struggling family.\n\nFrom there, the film builds an intense, smoldering first act, rooted in class tensions, long-simmering resentment, and rural isolation. But just as the conflict begins to escalate, *Bring Them Down* rewinds. Instead of moving forward, it shifts perspectives to retell much of what we’ve already seen, this time from Jack’s point of view. It’s a bold choice that aims to reframe the emotional stakes and add depth to the characters, particularly Jack, whose abuse at the hands of his father Gary (Paul Ready) helps make sense of his decisions. But the structure ends up stalling the film’s momentum rather than enriching it.\n\n[More Movies Like 'Bring Them Down'](https://cinephilecorner.com/lists/movies-like-bring-them-down/)",

Directed with a knowing wink and just enough bite, this seasonal horror-thriller finds a solid rhythm early on—thanks in large part to its lead duo—and mostly rides that momentum until the final act falters under the weight of an undercooked reveal.\n\nThe film follows Ally McCabe (Olivia Holt), a rising marketing exec who’s recently come under fire for a misfired ad campaign. Enter Jay (Mason Gooding), the charming new consultant brought in to clean up the mess. Ally’s convinced he’s here to replace her, but Jay has other plans: collaboration, flirtation, and, as it turns out, a company-sponsored dinner at a swanky restaurant on Valentine’s Day. Their date takes a sharp turn when they run into Ally’s ex, prompting an impulsive kiss between Ally and Jay—one that, unbeknownst to them, is seen by the Heart Eyes Killer, a masked psychopath targeting couples on Valentine’s Day for their perceived romantic sins.\n\n[More Movies Like 'Heart Eyes'](https://cinephilecorner.com/lists/movies-like-heart-eyes/)",

    "title": "Movie Review - Freaky Tales",
    "selftext": "https://youtube.com/shorts/kPcCZsyCFts?feature=shared\n\nFreaky Tales - 9/10. After directing a billion dollar film in “Captain Marvel,” you would assume that the director duo of Fleck & Boden would have had another picture lined up right at that second. Yes, they worked on “Masters Of The Air,” but its still surprising they wouldn’t have at least been considered for something else. Here, they return with “Freaky Tales,” a surprisingly effective hyperlink film which works as an action drama. Freaky Tales seems to be the directors’ decision to kind of go back to the basics with their director journey, making a movie that is leaning towards B film atmosphere and an indie way of going about in terms of its production and story. There’s even a part in this movie where you roam around a mosh pit, and the camera falls to the ground, as if you’re person that fell in there (low key, I feel the camera operator did fall and they just kept it in here). Each chapter is distinct in its tone, and interestingly enough, each of them actually do connect with each other. I thought that was a nice touch cause sometimes in hyperlink movies we see some characters never having significant connections to others in some of the respective chapters. The stories are vibrant in energy and narrative, with the Oakland atmosphere heavily utilized here. I liked the Golden State Warriors real life game having a major factor in the story, as that gave the movie a kind of “Inglorious Basterds” tone to it (mixing fiction with reality). Due to the B film atmosphere, it makes the stories kinda more pulpier and more fun in a sense, and the creativity with the smaller budget here was a nice added touch too (adding in drawn animation or black and white footage in the background of a car was a nice touch).  The action is very kinetic and animated like in certain sequences in “Kill Bill” or in “Scott Pilgrim.” Freaky Tales is one of those movies that is destined to become a cult classic, and its one that is unique and interesting from start to finish. I was totally invested in each chapter, and each one felt different from the other in such an entertaining way. Though I did feel at certain parts the narrative was getting chaotic, the movie mostly had found its footing when these events were all slowly connecting to each other. When people complain there’s no original movies out right now, it annoys me because movies like this are there! Sure, they might not get a big release, but if they’re in a theater near you, go watch them! These movies used to come so often, but are now so far and few between. Entertaining, energetic, fun, and full of interesting life, Freaky Tales is a solid film!",

    "title": "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty [2013]",
    "selftext": "As the credits rolled in, I thought to myself, I look forward to another lazy day when I cozy up under the covers and replay this movie. This form of media that leaves you warm inside, with a singe of wonder and inspiration. I googled about five times today with keywords ‘feel good movies’, ‘cozy movies’, ‘slow happy movies’ and ended up playing Little Women (1994) this afternoon. It was exactly what I looked for, soft cold outside and warm cozy home where the characters live. Admittedly, I did not exactly pay attention to the whole movie, I played it while I was working out in my room. Yet it served its purpose, on a cloudy cold dark day, the second day of a very long weekend with no plans to look forward to, the movie did its job. Later in the night, as I set my dinner and searched through the Youtube homepage, I went over to close those google search tabs from afternoon. I saw this as a recommendation and without much thought into it, I started the movie.\n\nAbout 7 years ago back in college, I watched this movie, as I remember and I did not like it. To the point that I stopped it after the first twenty minutes which was odd. I always finish the movies or books I start no matter how much I dislike it. I suppose this one tested my limits that day. It is a funny irony today, I think this movie is from now on one of those that I will keep coming back to. I do not write about every movie I watch, I barely even think of writing about any. And now I have asked this to myself  a dozen times in the last hour, what changed? To love any work of art at second glance is not a surprising thing, however, in the spirit of self introspection, I certainly wonder what made me dislike this before. Let’s dig into that.\n\nAt the core of this movie, keeping aside the brilliant cinematography and storytelling, the charm is the what ifs and the cold dunks of reality. The world as we see it, dull and unaesthetic, often looks surreal when an outsider comes and films it on social media. There are trees and grass on both ends of the world, here in a small suburb in Rotterdam and there in the front yard of my home. I often admit to myself, how the grass looks greener here, the photo brighter and a strange tint sets on the lens here. I say, maybe the cinematographers are not wrong when they yellow tint the Mexican border. Maybe I am so used to seeing places through this lens of social filter that now it is an inherent feature of the places I have been to. The same place, seen through the eyes of an outsider, looks unfamiliar, home but better. The colours in the life of Walter Mitty change as we progress through the movie, somewhat literally. \n\nHave you ever daydreamed? If you were to daydream right now, maybe a scene or an act that you have been hoping for or something even more frivolous, maybe you are the winner walking up to the stage or the girl you are crushing on just walked across the room towards you, how do you think of yourself in it? Do you imagine forgetting the words to say into the mic on that stage, or awkwardly standing next to her unable to make the conversation? Maybe if we are cynical enough, but rather,  daydreams are a place of comfort. We are charming, confident, and all the things that we are not. If there was a genie and a wish, turn me into my imagination. If I was to think of it in colours, this life of mine and the one I daydream about, it would be the same colours as in the life of Walter Mitty. \n\nSaying this movie feels relatable is strange, the rational mind asks who funds the spontaneity, who sets the opportunities and countless others. If I were to retold my life as a movie, however sincere, I would add some creative changes to the actual script, some coincidences would feel almost ridiculous if not in a movie, some actions would be childish if not taken by the protagonist, the hero. Life can be that way sometimes, watching the same story unfold, the same person grow from day one, sometimes even the most ridiculous, impossible, heroic things seem normal. We rarely are the heroes in our own stories. What is relatable to me is the grey life of Walter Mitty, the life he lives before the great adventure. I live that life everyday. In my daydreams, the world is brighter, colourful just like Walter Mitty’s. I do not jump from buildings or possess superhuman strengths, I am more humble, I justify this as being true to life. Although seven years ago, I did do all of that, become a hauntingly gorgeous vampire, or a rich aristocrat. Back then, the effect of daydreams wasn’t just a mere amusement, it was a welcomed escape. When that 18 year old watched this movie, the cold dunks of reality of Walter Mitty felt personal, as if someone tried to awaken me from one such dream. Today and in the last decade, I have learned a great deal about the person I am. I still dream of frivolous what ifs, I always will, just not as an escape but a part of life, a brighter more colourful life. Maybe some of that colour from the secret life of MT might just seep into this one.",

Story revolves around a couple, British intelligence agent George Woodhouse investigates a software leak, with his wife Kathryn, also an agent, among the suspects. I liked the way how they stressed through all possibilities and characters which reminded me of Knives out. While goes through all possibilities, it also succeed in generating a kind of curiosity to understand what had happened and what is behind all this and put the audience shocked and encourages them to understand more about this. Movie had a classy looking in all its aspects, it is subtle and simply presented, but deep and layered while goes through it. Some camera shots pretty much reminded me of old classic movies, especially that of Alfred Hitchcock's.

    "selftext": "Didn't satisfied me at all because of the overdose of cringe moments, probably higher and heavier than the bomb America put in Japan during world war 2. It contains lot of references from almost all boxing and sports drama movies that is half cooked. Appreciates director's effort for watching this much movies. Over use of sentiments caused the main problem here. Appreciate the effort pepe has taken for the movie, but it wasted because of the low quality of screenplay. Sentiment scenes made me cringe most of the time and it also makes the movie an unrealistic one. Most of the characters in this movie are cringe as hell. Relationship between pepe and the character who played his daughter also made me cringe, that girl is annoying as hell. Antagonist was alright till he scream like a dinosaur when a needle makes his back hurt. But overall he was fine comparing to others, nice performance. Some of the positives I have found in this movie are performances of Pepe and his combination with Lijomol. Technical side was fine, fight scenes and boxing combination was alright. Pepe's character relationship with his daughter is cringe pro max, she is totally annoying. Screenplay also contain lot of cringe moments. Vijayararghavn's portions are also unnecessary and cringe. Movie contains lots of cringe moments, one that truly worked and satisfied for me in this movie was the combination of protagonist and his wife. Lijomol did a fine role, her combination with pepe was satisfying for me. Overall it is a boxing drama movie which had a screenplay which contain lot of cringe moments, unrealistic writing and annoyable characters.\n\nLetterboxd : [https://boxd.it/67lJb](https://boxd.it/67lJb)",

    "selftext": "It's honestly pretty great, and for me it's full of a pretty rich history. I watched Nosferatu earlier in the year and made mention at the time that it feels very dracula-y and guess I didn't ever look into whether they were closely related only tof find out that Nosferatu stole so much from Stokers book that his widow took them to court and won. And wildly, they'd destroyed most of the copies, only for it to still go on to be **The Blueprint** for horror movies they watched it to get ready and make this movie during the Great Depression, and it's wild who's doing it well and who's doing it poorly. \n\nBela Lugosi is certainly Dracula in the cultural eye, it's a wild movie that it feels like everyone had seen at least part of, but I don't know offhand if I'd ever seen it fully. \n\nDracula has no fangs here, because it's based on the stage play which is based on the book- and in the stageplay, you have to enunciate so much the fangs would be wasted detail no one could see. \n\nFor a movie I thought I'd just tolerate, I have to admit that I had more or less forgotten the great vibe that these early Universal pictures had. \n\nI do puppet reviews of movies, so here's Dracula, a movie where they cut out a man (Renfield) eating a fly in such a way that I was about 80% he'd assaulted a passed out woman. \n\n[https://youtu.be/ncWqd33rd-Y?si=\\_AH3UPwx1KpGqJ5-](https://youtu.be/ncWqd33rd-Y?si=_AH3UPwx1KpGqJ5-)\n\n",

    "selftext": "Read the full review and see our score here: [**https://firstpicturehouse.com/sinners-2025-review-the-first-true-smash-horror-event-of-the-year/**](https://firstpicturehouse.com/sinners-2025-review-the-first-true-smash-horror-event-of-the-year/)\n\nJordan and Pippen. Venus and Serena. Cookies and Cream. Enter Ryan Coogler and Michael B. Jordan. They have now worked together 5 times with Coogler behind the chair, and each time, they’ve produced nothing short of wonders on the big screen, with *Sinners* being their most recent feature. They started with 2013’s biographical drama Fruitvale Station, telling the true story of Oscar Grant, who police officers murdered, and it was clear that the two knew how to tell a powerful message through cinema. \n\nFlashforward to today, as *Sinners* is out and silencing those who have been worried about the state of movies in 2025. It follows twin brothers Smoke and Stack (both played by Michael B. Jordan) who come back to their hometown to open a juke bar and find vampires waiting for them. With phenomenal cinematography, terrific musical performances and score, excellent performances from the leads and the supporting cast, and a genre-bending story that leaves you shaken to your core, *Sinners* has established itself as the best movie of 2025 so far. \n\n*Sinners* is such a rich story. Like if this script were food, it would be a red velvet cake. There are so many layers that this movie gets into with all its characters. The first half of this movie is admittedly very slow as it introduces all the characters and locations we’ll be spending the next 2 hours with. I didn’t think it was bad at all, as it laid the groundwork for Michael B. Jordan to establish his two characters as two completely separate people. Similar to what Robert Pattinson did this year in *Mickey 17,* he plays twins whose differences lie under the surface. Smoke is the cold businessman. He cares about his money, and he will kill anyone who messes with him. We see from his estranged relationship with his wife Annie (Wunmi Mosaku) why he closes himself off, but that’s for you to discover. Stack is a little more of a people person, with the ability to work a crowd at a train station to get people to come to their juke bar. They both have their issues that they battle with, but their core tenet is that they look out for each other, no matter what. \n\nSome other elements of the story have been done before with the vampires. What is very clear with *Sinners,* however, is that Ryan Coogler has a clear and distinct voice, and when he wants to tell a story like this one, it’s going to be delivered in a way that just flat-out works. In a time where it seems like no movies are breaking out that aren’t a part of an existing IP, *Sinners* is proof that these blockbuster-type movies can not just be financially successful but meaningful to audience members. His vision is one filled with passion, creativity, and wisdom that jumps off the screen and lands in your head and heart. He blends so many different ideas and genres to the point where even if they all don’t hit, they bring enough to the table to at least be engaging, if not more thought-provoking. \n\nVisually, this movie is a masterpiece. You are immediately transported to the 1930s South, and it is truly an immersive experience. Cinematographer Autumn Durald Arkapaw frequently infused long, mesmerizing long shots into truly gorgeous scenes. They aren’t just stylish, as they play a major role in the storytelling. Some establish locations, while one in particular is what many are calling one of the best scenes of the year and Coogler’s filmography. That specific scene gave me chills with how beautiful the imagery and dancing were, the way the camera moved around this mill, and how the music swelled to such an impactful climax. It is so perfectly choreographed, too, knowing just how many people had to be in the exact right spot for the camera, it truly is a moment that makes you feel lucky to have seen it.\n\nMusic plays such a massive role in *Sinners,* and two-time Oscar winner and frequent collaborator with Coogler, Ludwig Göransson, was up to the task. The movie paints a picture of how music can be so powerful that it breaks the barrier between light and dark. It tells stories of pain and culture through the blues, with newcomer Miles Caton singing an incredible song about breaking from his father’s expectations. Meanwhile, the main vampire, played by Jack O’Connell, introduces himself to the main cast through a song of his own, but has an even better one after the night has already devolved into hell and his army has been created as they rally around him, dancing an Irish jig. \n\nI loved how they said the vampire’s design was inspired by Death’s design from *Puss In Boots: The Last Wish,* because the same tension I felt when he was on screen, I felt for each vampire appearance. While the gore was effective, I found it interesting that until the climactic end fight, almost all the vampire turnings were done off-screen. Their presence was still felt, namely when Omar Benson Miller’s character, Cornbread, is about to be attacked. The scene is set so that the darkness of night is only broken up by the flickering lights of fireflies. That is, until two pairs of lights remain constant, those being the eyes of vampires, ready to attack. \n\n...",

Characters are brilliantly intertwined each other and movie follows a sarcastic approach throughout its events. Some scores are good and it makes the movie more interesting. However, movie became a bit down after second half. Comedy elements are bit low in the second half comparing to first half because it shifts into an emotional track. Screenplay also contain its own faults and it is evident that they lost the control of maintaining the consistency of the screenplay. Screenplay of the movie became a bit wandered after first half, during second half. I didn't got a satisfying climax to the movie. However, the movie became back on track by the arrival of Babu Ramachandran from 'Vallathoru Katha'. I didn't expected it and it was so surprising for me. His portions are well made. Movie in totality follows a sarcastic comedy track with a dark comedy mode. Movie trolls many things and many persons and it was well taken and satisfying for me even though I am their fan boy. Like I said earlier, the characters are more interesting and performance wise they did a great job, especially that of Basil Joseph's and our convincing star Suresh Krishna's. Suresh Krishna was great in this movie and he deserves mention as equivalent of Basil Joseph. Rajesh Madavan also worth mentioning along with them. What a great performance he made. Bro got a good future. Anishma, Siju Sunny and Babu Anthony also did a great job. I felt Babu Anthony's character as unfitting at some situation. At some portions I felt that he is tired by acting. But in some situations, he did a great job. Overall a good dark comedy movie which follows a sarcastic mode throughout the movie, which followed by first half. Even though screenplay became a bit messy and down in the second half, it is brilliantly masked by perfect characters, performance and successfully maintained emotional track. Score also deserves mentioning, especially that of the antagonist during climax portion. Overall a worth watch.\n\nFollow me on letterboxd : [https://boxd.it/67lJb](https://boxd.it/67lJb)",

    "selftext": "As soon as Sinners ended, I wanted to watch it all over again. True, part of that was because I didn’t catch everything the characters were saying in the first act—their delivery is often mumbled, and the thick accents don’t help (definitely one to watch with subtitles if you can). But more than that, the horror-musical-drama hybrid is simply a flat-out fun experience. It’s the kind of big movie where everything works: strong characters, fantastic performances, suspenseful moments with razor-sharp dialogue, exhilarating action, gut-punching tragedy, humor, and some genuinely electric musical sequences. It uses its first hour to carefully build its world and characters, and then, around the halfway mark, everything clicks—and from there, it doesn’t let go.\n\nNo matter how touched or moved I often am by cinema, I can’t deny that being entertained was what drew me to it in the first place, and director Ryan Coogler brings everything he learned from working on big IPs (Creed, Black Panther) to do just that. Freed from the limitations of franchise storytelling, he translates it into something entirely his own. Sinners feels more unpredictable, more playful, and more confident.\n\nThat’s not to say this feels like a filmmaker completely unleashed. The only things that hold Sinners back from masterpiece status are some frustrating choices that feel like they may have been the result of studio mandates. There’s the tired framing device: the film opens with a flashy, attention-grabbing sequence, only to flash back to “1 day earlier.” There are not one but two end-credit sequences. And on top of that, both the movie and its marketing spoil its biggest mystery far too early (don’t worry—I won’t!). These choices certainly dull the impact of a first viewing, but they don’t take away from the film’s overall power.\n\nRead my full review at https://reviewsonreels.ca/2025/04/18/sinners/",

    "title": "Warfare (2025) Review: Garland and Mendoza Reshape the War Genre",
    "selftext": "Read the full review and see our score here: [https://firstpicturehouse.com/warfare-2025-review-garland-and-mendoza-reshape-the-war-genre/](https://firstpicturehouse.com/warfare-2025-review-garland-and-mendoza-reshape-the-war-genre/)\n\n...\n\nAlex Garland’s previous film, *Civil War*, created an immersive experience for audiences to explore an alternate reality through the perspective of journalists covering a fictional modern American Civil War. His latest film, *Warfare*, takes a different approach on the immersive spectrum by presenting a brutally realistic portrayal of a U.S. Navy SEAL platoon during the Battle of Ramadi in the Iraq War. Based on a true event that co-writer and co-director Ray Mendoza experienced during his service, *Warfare* combines Mendoza’s military background with Garland’s neutral and captivating style. This collaboration results in a unique and enthralling film, anchored by a talented ensemble cast and enhanced by overstimulating audio and visuals.\n\nThere isn’t much of a story in *Warfare* beyond experiencing the challenges faced by a SEAL squad in the heat of battle. This film retells a dangerous mission involving a Navy SEALs platoon headed by leading Officer Erik (Will Poulter) as they get trapped behind enemy lines. Conceptually, it is similar to *Black Hawk Down,* but it never strays from the immediate area of combat. The focus remains entirely on the squad in real-time, creating an anxiety-inducing style of filmmaking that most audiences may not be accustomed to, especially in a war setting. Many war films will often shift focus away from the action to provide a momentary narrative break, but *Warfare* does not allow for such breaks. You are thrust into the experience of this US Navy SEAL team, immersed in the reality of their situation.\n\nThe sense of realism in the film *Warfare* is heightened by its lack of a musical score. It opens with a wholesome scene of brotherly camaraderie, featuring soldiers dancing to Eric Prydz’s “Call on Me.” The film concludes with another song, “Dancing and Blood” by Low. *Warfare* is devoid of a score and is instead filled with the sounds of the environment of war.  Ambient sounds, such as locals yelling, dogs barking, and footsteps getting louder, serve as audio cues—not only for the characters but also for the audience—emphasizing that everything we hear is intentional.\n\nThis lack of a musical score contributes to the film’s realistic depiction of a day in the life of a U.S. Navy SEAL in battle. In real life, there is no dramatic orchestra playing in the background; all you hear are the sounds of war. The audio in *Warfare* almost seems exaggerated at times, with deafening gunfire and tinnitus-inducing explosions. This serves as a reminder that firearms are very loud, and audiences have become accustomed to unrealistic gun sounds in action films.\n\nMendoza and Garland want to convey the reality of what guns truly sound like, along with the repercussions of being near gunfire. One of the film’s most shocking scenes is particularly effective because of its incredible sound design. As a result, it delivers a more frightening jump scare than many modern horror movies could achieve.\n\nThe sound design in *Warfare* is not only memorable but also complemented by an impressive cast that includes Charles Melton, Joseph Quinn, D’Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai, Will Poulter, Cosmo Jarvis, and Michael Gandolfini. This could go down as *Once Upon a Time in Hollywood* level of casting\\*.\\* With a blend of rising stars and established actors, each performer brought a distinct identity to their character, making it easy to differentiate among them in such a chaotic film. Mendoza initially considered hiring actual military personnel to portray the characters, similar to the approach taken in *The 15:17 to Paris*. However, Garland noted that due to time constraints and the need for actors to navigate extensive scenes, they ultimately required the professionalism and experience of seasoned actors.\n\nThis ended up working out because even though actual military personnel have experienced these kinds of battles, the sheer emotional training and perseverance that the actors can portray needs that level of acting training, and the cast of *Warfare* did just that. The intense vernacular of military code, the effects of PTSD, and the sheer agony of pain are just some of the things that these actors had to embody, and everybody did their part. There was one performance that I initially found hard to believe due to how young the character looked, and his actions seemed less genuine at first. However, it’s important to remember that the military is filled with young recruits who have just enlisted, and sometimes this is their first experience in combat. The level of shock they experience can be difficult to emulate. Nevertheless, D’Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai evolved into his role and became increasingly convincing as the film progressed.",

What it really is, at its core, is a quiet elegy for the traditions we cling to, the routines that define us, and the slow, inevitable passage of time. Written and directed by Carson Lund in his feature debut, *Eephus* doesn’t try to dazzle you with big emotional swings or dramatic sports triumphs. Instead, it plays out like a slow Sunday afternoon in late summer: warm, unhurried, a little melancholic, and deeply rooted in the rituals of ordinary life.\n\nSet in small-town Massachusetts, *Eephus* follows the final matchup between two long-running men’s rec league baseball teams: the River Dogs and Adler’s Paint. Their beloved ballpark, Soldier’s Field, is being shut down to make way for a new school—an understandable decision, but one that hits these middle-aged men harder than they might’ve expected. For years, they’ve come together on Sundays to play. Not for trophies, not for crowds, but for something harder to define: a sense of belonging, a piece of identity, a break from the responsibilities and complexities of life outside the lines.\n\n[Read More Movie Reviews from Cinephile Corner](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/)",

It deals with the story of a teenage girl who works for a secret assassination group called shadows, whom works like a ninjas and the only problem here is that she is doing all these mess for just a boy she met two days ago.

Examples include Raid franchaise, The Night comes for us, Headshot, meranthau, etc. This movie also can be included in that category.

Here are some B movies that I really enjoyed watching that you guys might like to queue up on an idle Sunday noon.\n\n(To be ultra clear, these are not movies that are so bad that they are good but they are movies that are underrated but still fun to watch.)\n\n# Awesome B-Grade Movies 1. Evil Dead (1981)\n\nSam Raimi is breaking the net these days with the Spider-Men in [**No Way Home**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/spiderman-no-way-home-everything-you-expected-and-more), trying to save the day.

Enter the Deadites - undead Zombies imbued with regeneration powers from hell.\n\nAsh's sole mission in this franchise is to chop down every Deadite in his way and exclaim \"Grooovee!\"\n\n***Check out*** [***My Favorite Retrofuturism Movie Genres***](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/types-of-retrofuturism-movies)\n\n# 2. Evil Dead 3: Army of Darkness (1992)\n\nThe word of mouth for Evil Dead was so good when it came out that, I watched the Army of Darkness without hesitation. In fact, I saw this movie before watching the first in the series.\n\nWhen Evil Dead dropped, international movies such as the ones from the US took several months to years to be released in India. So if the word of mouth was good, it would feed a lot of hype, and the number of people who would watch it went up way before release.\n\n***You might like*** [***Classic Paul Verhoeven Movies To Celebrate Halloween***](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/classic-paul-verhoeven-movies-to-celebrate-halloween)\n\n# 3.

These days you would never associate Quentin Tarantino's name with B-movies, but this one was a standard B-movie with a relatively low production cost and a less-than-mainstream release.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pqpmbqnw0dve1.png?width=417&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b931de58a3f1bbf97ceafb9eeb760b91c08782e\n\nKurt Russell plays the role of the easy-to-hate serial killer who traps young women in a death chamber built into his crash-proof car.

There's Cash from Tango and Cash, played by Kurt Russell, Kim Cattrall from the relatively new Sex and the City series, and Po's dad from Kung-fu Panda, James Hong.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/av7o1hmgzcve1.png?width=892&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea68a65621b5f56af24cf24e18a3374e0fbe7b73\n\nThat's just the beginning - the plot is outlandish, to say the least, with kidnapping, magic, and great action sequences.

The plot of Tremors 1 revolves around underground goo-gahs called Graboids, which pop up like a jack-in-the-box to snatch up whatever is walking around.\n\n[Bringing home the Bacon](https://preview.redd.it/6hamp2knzcve1.jpg?width=992&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8cdbec48890b5ebdfa84754484377ac91aa1ddfd)\n\nThese salt of the earth people get together to survive the unexpected attack and we get to watch a whole lot of practical effects with explosions, alien goo, and more.\n\n***B Grade at its best in*** [***Hubie Halloween - Netflix Movie Review***](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/hubie-halloween-netflix-movie-review)\n\n# 6. Fright Night (1985)\n\nThe best thing about this vampire movie is the detailed, practical effects that keep the audience on the edge of their couch. Chris Sarandon delivers one of his most memorable performances here, along with Roddy Macdowell of Planet of the Apes fame. Sarandon went on to give us The Princess Bride and The Nightmare Before Christmas after this.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dee2l79w0dve1.png?width=912&format=png&auto=webp&s=638aae266f60fe639aa2253fa1b913a6b4865047\n\nThe plot centers on this teenager teaming up with a TV personality within the movie to take down an ancient badass vampire and the minions he has raised. The end sees the teen lead end up with the girl in a happily ever after. This movie is a comedy horror which should not have been classified as a B movie, it's that good.\n\n# 7. If Looks Could Kill (1991)\n\nThis movie is basically a cross between Spider-Man: Far From Home and 21 Jump Street. This Never Been Kissed clone sees Richard Grieco battle villainous baddies as an undercover spy in a school, when on an overseas school trip.\n\n[Richard Greico - The Budget 007](https://preview.redd.it/8kbh4xsqzcve1.jpg?width=723&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5d29036c374a6b5eaa8e5291d3ecba9bdc23ddd6)\n\nIt's been quite a while since I've seen this movie on cable, but I still remember it having a pretty solid plot, good humor, and great action sequences with practical effects. Effects used here seem to be the bread and butter of the genre.\n\n# 8. Flash Gordon (1980)\n\nA campy depiction of the American Dream ( still unsure of what that entails ), Flash Gordon tells the story of a quarterback going on space adventures to defeat an evil space dictator.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pfefp0zszcve1.png?width=912&format=png&auto=webp&s=d869c943854fdf96ed59ac3e1ae755ba9282ca3b\n\nIf you forget that it's too on the nose and how intricately campy it is, the movie becomes much more enjoyable. I was introduced to Flash Gordon through the cartoon [**Defenders of the Earth**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/80s-and-90s-cartoons-i-grew-up-with-part-ii), which puts this movie squarely on my to-watch-later list. Yes, the last pic in the collage is from Ted about the teddy that gains sentience through a well-placed wish.\n\nI personally love the soundtrack \" Flash! Savior of the Universe,\" which was popularized in the Ted movie. It's both cheesy yet catchy and highly enjoyable, and can be used in a hundred comedic scenarios.\n\n# 9.

But even though the movie is written and executed well, it does have its obvious flaws, hence it landed here on this list.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qy3v4egwzcve1.jpg?width=410&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ecb0cb19031d29366ebd6d205ff7cc4d6fef6281\n\nThe emperor of Outworld, Shao Kahn, has plans to conquer the realm of Earth by bringing back Queen Sindel from the dead to lead his invasion forces.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ye7zl17zzcve1.png?width=906&format=png&auto=webp&s=70514d08d6f948486b1db1f861d1f1f1d0f4cdf8\n\nThe Outworld emperor Shao Kahn opens a portal to Earthrealm and has resurrected Queen Sindel, Princess Kitana's long-deceased mother, to facilitate his invasion.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y0j5vt740dve1.jpg?width=868&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=af75f1b06c9e9c5ffd8d6bc864a5a95d13903960\n\nThunder god Raiden and Earthrealm warriors Liu Kang, Sonya Blade, and Johnny Cage try to defend themselves, but Kahn kills Cage.\n\nJames Remar plays Raiden in this truly awesome computer and video game adaptation who reminds me of Christopher Lambert in another movie, \"The Hunted.\" Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa plays Shang Tsung, who is another excellent actor who has acted in yet another B-grade movie, \"Showdown in Little Tokyo\", and even in the latest 2018 [**Lost in Space Netflix Adaptation**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/lost-in-space-netflix-series-review).\n\nBrian Thompson plays Shao Kahn to perfection in this amazing computer game movie. He looks like the perfect antagonist, scary face right out of the box ( I'm sure he is a wonderfully nice person in real life ), and an equally scary and deep voice. He has played roles in cult movies such as Terminator (1984), Cobra (1986), and Dragonheart (1996). I even remember him from a great [**Star Trek TNG**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/cheerful-episodes-of-star-trek-tng-and-tos) episode where Riker takes on the commander role in a Klingon ship.\n\n# 10.

Within just a few years, Lundgren starred in amazing movies that I think needed more recognition, such as \"Showdown in Little Tokyo,\" \"Star Trek Generations,\" and \"Rocky IV.\"\n\nIn this movie, you see both Courteney Cox and Christina Pickles act, which you would remember as a mother and daughter duo in the [**90s sitcom**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/best-90s-sitcoms) Friends. Here, Cox plays He-Man's romantic interest and Pickles as the Sorceress of Castle Grayskull.

Novocaine (2025) is a movie that has this on lock with an interesting premise of a man who can literally feel no pain, and goes about trying to live a normal life, leading to an amazing adventure.\n\nJack Quaid stars in this movie as the average Joe who turns his life-threatening disability into a superpower to save the woman whom he loves, leading to a lotta twists and turns and a highly entertaining journey.\n\n# TMJ Rating: 🍿🍿🍿🍿/ 5\n\n\n\n# The Plot of Novocaine (2025) Movie\n\n\n\nNathan Caine is a mild-mannered bank employee who suffers from Congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA), which makes life unbearably complex and joyless, until he falls for the unassuming new hire at his workplace named Sherry.\n\nThen it's all sunshine and rainbows for a while until his boring bank becomes the target of a not-so-boring bank heist peppered with generous portions of violence. Sherry gets kidnapped by the bank robbers, and then Nathan Caine goes from Clarke Kent to a budget version of Superman.\n\nThis is a Jack Quaid ride all the way with a great sidekick appearance from Jacob Batalon, who transforms in the movie runtime from \"The Guy in the Chair\" ( in [**Tom Holland's Spider-Man**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/spiderman-no-way-home-everything-you-expected-and-more) ) to the guy breaking the chair over the bad guy's head.\n\n\n\n***You might like*** [***Jackpot! Prime Video Movie Review***](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/jackpot-prime-video-movie-review)\n\n\n\nBetty Gabriel as the determined cop is a bit wasted in the movie considering her awesome range, with me still remembering her as being the co-founder of the \"Coagula\" in \"[**Get Out**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/movies-about-dynamics-of-cults)\" - one of the best horror movies ever made. Betty's voice is so deep and has so much gravitas that it fits her role in Jordan Peele's directorial debut perfectly.\n\nEvery other character is just a blur or a blink and you'll miss it appearance in the movie, but it doesn't affect how enjoyable this action comedy can be.\n\n\n\n# The Action and Practical Effects\n\n\n\nThe plotline calls for horrifically graphic and gory scenes where the lead, Jack Quaid, gets impaled, shot, and thrown into walls - all with him wearing an unconcerned or slightly annoyed expression instead of yelling in excruciating pain.\n\nOne particular scene is impressive, where Nathan Caine played by Jack Quaid, transforms in the goriest way possible into something of a Wolverine from the X-Men, taking down a henchman in the process. This scene is filmed well.\n\nOverall, the practical effects and CGI are handled well, but some of the action sequences are so insanely graphic that only hardcore gore fans and actual medical doctors can verify if they are accurate. The sound design is pretty decent as well, adding a layer of realism to this ridiculously violent action movie.\n\nJust like his role in [**The Boys**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/the-boys-series-review), he has this expression on his face throughout the movie where he either doesn't know what's going on, what is going to happen, or what he's going to do about a certain pressing crisis. He retains this look throughout the movie right till the end, and it doesn't feel out of place, which is the result of good direction and great acting.\n\nHe seems to be slowly breaking out of his everyman stereotype into full-on action, although his nervous characters in most of his works, such as Brad Boimler on [**Star Trek: Lower Decks**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/star-trek-lower-decks-animated-series-cracking-jokes-with-easter-eggs), are thoroughly enjoyable and do exceedingly well in animated voice roles.\n\n\n\n***Check out*** [***Hit Man Netflix Movie Review: Richard Linklater's Hilarious Dark***](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/hit-man-netflix-movie-review-glen-powell) ***Comedy***\n\n\n\nKevin Hart, on the other hand, has abruptly tried to project himself as a full-on action star in movies such as Netflix's \"Lift\" and, to some extent, his role in the Borderlands movie.\n\nJacob Batalon does a lot with the screen time he has been given and reminds me of the character named \"A$$face\" in [**Ride Along**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1kMhOTuHk) and Ride Along 2.\n\nI also like that he hasn't used a wig that he generally uses in most movies due to his Alopecia, which looks fine. In fact, I think he would make for a great Big Bad for the Young Avengers, or even a different take on Lex Luthor.\n\nI actually wouldn't mind a well-executed sequel to this action comedy that lowkey reminds me of [**Deadpool**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/deadpool-wolverine-a-fun-ride), as the main characters in both movies don't care much about injuries in the short term.\n\n\n\n# Wrapping Up\n\nThe entire Novocaine 2025 movie is thoroughly enjoyable with excellent direction, an uncomplicated plotline, amazing visuals, and a good cast that shares great chemistry. Watch this movie if you enjoy a good action comedy with an uncomplicated plot and amazing execution.\n\n\n\n***Like this review?*** [**Subscribe**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/contact) ***to*** [**themoviejunkie.com**](http://themoviejunkie.com/)***!***",

What makes this movie different from others is the use of Surrealism. From the initial stages to throughout the movie contains a lot of dream sequences which used to emphasize the condition of escapism and also to portray the contrast between the reality and illusion by contrasting the reality of japan during the pre and post world war situation which is threatened with disasters such as earthquake with the fantasy world in which contains the elements of Surrealism in order to portray escapism of the narrator from the real world to a fantasy world where Jiro develops his dream to become an aircraft designer. It also emphasizes the loneliness of Jiro in his life along with his confusion regarding the complexity arouses from escaping to reality to fantasy. Then the movie tells what happens to his visions and robotic life after the arrival of a particular character. The movie uses poetical language in order to communicate the emotional transitions of Jiro. This itself makes the movie different from other autobiographical movies. Scores of this movie creates a kind of flow to the narrative of the movie which flows like a slow river. It creates a sense of vibrancy to narrative and flows like a river. Jiro's characterization can be seen as one of the most unique portrayal of characters. The movie was narrated in a way that it questions while watching the climax of the movie whether it was hopeful or tragic and it put us in a confusion. One of the best movie.\n\nFollow me on Letterboxd : [https://boxd.it/67lJb](https://boxd.it/67lJb)",

    "selftext": "Having only recently become a fan of Jason Statham, I have no basis to tell whether *A Working Man* is better or worse than any of his previous “one man wrecking crew” films.  This one has a very grim tone, which certainly is appropriate for a story about human trafficking.  Even still, the dialog is surprisingly free of ironic quips from either Statham or the bad guys.  Everything is played completely straight by everyone involved, much to the movie’s detriment.  (There are a couple of funny reaction lines thrown in.)\n\nAs expected for this kind of film, Statham racks up an impressive body count over the course of the movie.  A website tells me that he is personally responsible for thirty-three deaths, and that sounds about right, although it felt like more.  Also as expected, he kills people in a variety of ways, some bloodier than others.  Even though he’s now fifty-seven, Statham shows no signs of slowing down, and he looks good in all of the fighting choreography.  \n\nWhat's unfortunate is that unlike [*The Beekeeper*](https://detroitcineaste.net/2024/01/30/the-beekeeper/), this movie doesn’t give Statham a single juicy line in the entire film.  (The funniest joke he makes is about a Bluetooth camera.)  Aside from Statham, the two young actresses playing daughters have the best lines in the film.  When David Harbor shows up in a cameo to chew the scenery a bit, I wished he could have played sidekick throughout the film.\n\nThis is director David Ayer’s second outing with Statham, and he seems to enjoy making these violent B-movie revenge fantasies.  He does an excellent job accentuating the grimy aspects of the story, particularly the underworld locations.  Ayer definitely has a gift for filming action sequences, which is put to good use here.\n\n*A Working Man* is a satisfactory throwback to the “one man as unstoppable army” films from the Eighties.  Although it’s well made and Jason Statham is reliably tough, the overwhelming seriousness of the story prevents it from being more than a standard search-and-kill-everyone mission.  Credit to director David Ayer for jazzing things up with an assortment of outlandish villains and phantasmagoric sets.  **Mildly recommended**.\n\n[https://detroitcineaste.net/2025/04/15/a-working-man-movie-review-and-analysis-jason-statham/](https://detroitcineaste.net/2025/04/15/a-working-man-movie-review-and-analysis-jason-statham/)",

    "selftext": "“The Amateur” stars Malek as Charlie Heller, a data decoder for the CIA. He is married to Sarah (Brosnahan), and things appear to be amazing until she goes on a work trip to London and is killed when a hostage situation breaks out. She was trying to save someone else when they decided to take her instead. When Charlie finds out about this, he is understandably upset, but even more so when a couple of leaders within the CIA refuse to do much to catch his wife’s killers.\n\nSome of the roles in “The Amateur” were wasted, in my opinion. Both Carlos and Inquiline were not involved in the main story for as long as I would have liked to see, but you could have taken out The Bear entirely, and the story would be pretty much identical. It’s a shame, too, since I think they could have expanded that into something for sure.\n\nMy favorite duo in “The Amateur” is, by far, Charlie and Henderson. Every scene when they are together is some of the best in the film. That’s why I was glad when they met up at the end again. Especially after Henderson chases Charlie down as he is on the run. Even though they part on good terms, there is a lot of turmoil between the two of them, although you get the feeling that Henderson has some respect for him in some way.\n\nIt’s fun to watch Charlie work his magic as he tracks down everyone who had a role in his wife’s death. One by one, he locates them, watches their patterns, and then devises a plan to eliminate them without getting too close. He does all of this using his knowledge he gained as a CIA employee. As he works through his list, Henderson and the CIA are closing in on tracking him down. After a couple of confrontations with Henderson, he finally manages to make his way to the last guy.\n\nMalek is great once again, even if this does give off “Mr. Robot” vibes a little bit. He knows how to immerse himself into a role and really punch it through. Even though Brosnahan is mostly just around in flashbacks and memories, she was just as good. Those two, combined with everyone else, made for a great cast. I also can’t find a lot about the story to dislike. It’s suspenseful, action-packed and leaves you wondering how it is going to end. Like I said earlier, some of the characters weren’t as well flushed out, and some were just outright ignored for no reason (Bernthal).\n\nCheck out the full review here:\n\n[https://1guysmindlessmoviereviews.com/2025/04/15/the-amateur/](https://1guysmindlessmoviereviews.com/2025/04/15/the-amateur/)",

    "selftext": "https://youtube.com/shorts/p_5S4waGzXY?feature=shared\n\nMurmur - 3/10. So I saw people making posts about this film’s positive initial reviews being highly criticized by the general public. Again, I felt like I had to wait a while before checking into this film, just to give myself a non biased look. For tamil cinema to just now do a full on found footage film is astonishing to say the least. After all these years of horror themed films, they never once thought to capitalize on the found footage genre? Never the less, we get “Murmur,” a film that starts off promisingly, but becomes a real try hard knock off of the brilliant “The Blair Witch Project.” See, the thing is is that just doing those audience reaction campaigns is not enough (and again, why are they just utilizing that technique when “Paranormal Activity” pioneered it from the late 00’s is beyond me!). For a found footage film, you need to also commit to the idea of making it feel real. The shots at times here are very polished and very cinematic. Yes, these characters are amateurs and they have a Youtube channel, but it just felt a little too glossy for a film of this nature. The conversations feel inauthentic, with the swearing and convos feeling super forced. For a movie that wants you to feel the incoming dread (which only appears in the last 20 minutes or so), there’s barely any solid buildup. The portion with the grandma being disturbed to talk about the myth was fine and actually could have launched the movie forward. Except, we are left with characters and situations that the viewer doesn’t care for. What could’ve been a great opportunity for a great pathbreaking genre film in tamil, ends up being a mediocre affair.",

Two clandestine soldiers are hired to monitor a mysterious ravine in the middle of nowhere, leading to a forbidden romance that blooms between the two tower guards.\n\n**TMJ Rating: 🍿🍿🍿/ 5**\n\n# The Plot of The Gorge Apple TV+ Movie\n\nTwo military personnel trained as exceptional snipers are hired to man two towers at either end of a Gorge to keep whatever is lurking inside the foggy depths contained.

Drasa, not wanting her new love to be torn to shreds by unimaginable creatures, skydives into the fog, after which the action really kicks off.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4bpcsq6obyue1.png?width=866&format=png&auto=webp&s=40a51ddf3bd946f4b20381f4b7b74ecc01849a9a\n\nOnce in The Gorge, Levi and Drasa find each other and discover that the history behind the monsters in the Gorge hides a few dark secrets which they were hired to guard. What follows is pretty good special effects and action that is enjoyable.\n\n***Check out the*** [***Types of Sci-Fi Movies: Take Your Pick***](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/types-of-sci-fi-movies-take-your-pick)\n\nBeware that there is nothing truly unique about the plot of this assembly line sci-fi action romance. You can see the twists coming from a tower away, but the action and the effects do make this movie watchable. I did enjoy the remix of the remix of Bob Dylan's All Along the Watchtower playing at a key moment in the movie when both operatives are in mortal danger ( which is all the time, really ).\n\n***Read*** ***Fallout TV Series: A Fitting Homage to a Beloved Game***\n\nI think this movie would have done better as a mini-series with a few actual twists thrown in. But that would probably be more expensive than the simple movie they came up with. Hence, the budget-friendly ( both time and money ) simple [**sci-fi movie**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/top-5-favorite-sci-fi-movies) that the guys at Apple TV+ settled on, probably to meet a quota of movies to be produced to keep the viewership up and increase the watch hours while gaining more subscribers.\n\nEven though the actors nail the acting part in the movie, there is only so much the stars can do to elevate the script and plot, which are significantly limiting.\n\n# Cinematography and Special Effects\n\nThe long and wide shots of The Gorge are really beautiful and one of the better aspects of this movie, which is not a great compliment to the director of this movie. But credit where credit is due - The Gorge, which is in equal parts breathtaking and mysterious.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nfo0bqsubyue1.png?width=1027&format=png&auto=webp&s=d03314713a2af5ff02cc5345be282cda467f9cec\n\nThe watch towers that are manned by the snipers Levi and Drasa look pretty cool, probably made with super-strength concrete to house a perch and any heavy-duty weapons.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f3vg02fwbyue1.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=32594d84ec2e261638f227c50faf63a66da92725\n\nThe action shots in the night with the mini-guns going off in the night look pretty cool, used to kill the monsters and creatures that periodically try and scale the Gorge and reach the towers on either side. Considering Miles Teller starred in Top Gun: Maverick and War Dogs, some of my all-time favorite movies, this is one movie that he probably will forget pretty soon.\n\n# Should You Watch It? Sure!\n\nIf you are in the mood for a mediocre sci-fi action romance that has cool visuals, including monstrous creatures and hi-tech gunfights, then this is the movie for you. Watch this in case you are bored and want a hit of sci-fi action sans twists.\n\n***Like this review?*** [**Subscribe**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/contact) ***to*** [**themoviejunkie.com**](http://themoviejunkie.com/)***!***",

    "selftext": "David Cronenberg’s [Rabid (1977)](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/rabid-1977/) builds on the raw, squirm-inducing energy of his [debut feature *Shivers*](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/shivers-1975/), but elevates it with a bigger story, clearer characters, and a more polished sense of direction. As a sophomore effort, *Rabid* still feels like an early work from a filmmaker who would go on to deliver more refined and layered horrors in films like *The Fly*, [Scanners](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/scanners-1981/), *Videodrome*, and *Dead Ringers*, but there’s an unmistakable step forward in craft here—especially in how Cronenberg handles tone, pacing, and sheer body-horror spectacle.\n\nAt the center of *Rabid* is Rose, played by adult movie icon Marilyn Chambers in her first performance as a leading actress in a mainstream film. After a motorcycle accident leaves her severely injured, she’s treated with an experimental skin graft by Dr. Dan Keloid (Howard Ryshpan). But something goes wrong—or maybe exactly as intended—and Rose develops a bizarre new appendage, a phallic stinger tucked away in her armpit that she uses to feed on human blood. Her victims don’t just die—they become rabid, infected carriers of a violent plague that spreads rapidly throughout Montreal.\n\n[More Movie Reviews](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/)",

    "selftext": "Of all David Cronenberg’s early triumphs, [Scanners (1981)](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/scanners-1981/) might be the most iconic for a single shot—and the most inconsistent when you sit through the rest of the runtime. Yes, this is the movie with *that* exploding head, a scene that’s become a permanent fixture in sci-fi and horror highlight reels. But beyond its instantly legendary gore moment, *Scanners* is a strange and often uneven ride, full of fascinating ideas that feel more exciting on paper than they often do on screen.\n\nThis was Cronenberg’s first major commercial success in the U.S., a leap forward in scale after the low-budget horror of [*Shivers*](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/shivers-1975/) and [*Rabid*](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/rabid-1977/). It expands his familiar obsessions—body horror, institutional paranoia, and the hidden corruption in society’s underbelly—into the realm of science fiction with far greater ambition. But unlike *The Brood* (1979), which came right before and feels more emotionally jagged and tonally complete, *Scanners* plays like a conceptual bridge: a proof of what Cronenberg would soon achieve more powerfully in *Videodrome* and *The Fly*.\n\n[Movies like Scanners](https://cinephilecorner.com/lists/movies-like-scanners/)",

Close to death, the lion brings Sergei to a girl ( [**Calypso**](https://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/who-is-calypso)) who heals him with a mystical potion.\n\nFast Forward a few years to Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Kraven, who hunts down bad guys such ass arms traffickers and the like. When Nikolai sees his sons slipping away from his grasp, he tips off Kraven to the kidnapping of his half-brother Dmitri by his rival Alessandro Nivola, who has powers of his own, such as super strength and more.\n\n\n\n***Check out*** [***Spider-Man: No Way Home - Everything You Expected and More!***](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/spiderman-no-way-home-everything-you-expected-and-more)\n\n\n\nThis leads to an epic family reunion, which doesn't go exactly as planned, with Nikolai seeing his sons come together as a family. You also get to see a unique super-powered individual known only as the foreigner, played by Christopher Abbott, whom you might remember from [**Poor Things**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/poor-things-2024-movie-review) as William Dafoe's protege.\n\n\n\n# The Cast of Kraven The Hunter Movie\n\nAaron Taylor Johnson shows his mastery of accents yet again as Sergei Kravenoff in this movie. I've seen him do a flawless US accent as he was starting off in the Kickass movie franchise, his Eastern European and Slavic accent as Quicksilver, and now his Russian accent as Kraven must be a complete cakewalk.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r1bdq9fj4uue1.png?width=905&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c8198e861b88901717a7969e1035aa397b715eb\n\nComing to the substance of the lead character in this movie, even compared to the role of Quicksilver, the role is entirely lackluster, lacking proper character motivations, and tie-ins with other [**Marvel characters**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/2018/11/05/marvels-the-avengers-fight-styles) are almost non-existent.\n\nThe action led by Aaron here is top-notch, even if it is just a tad bit gratuitous, but then again, it is one of the things that makes this movie watchable. It is mindless action and entertainment that will fill a timeslot.\n\nOne of my all-time fav actors, [**Jon Xue Zhang**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/jon-xue-zhang-bloodboots-the-brothers-sun) of [**The Brothers Sun**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/the-brothers-sun-netflix-series-review) fame, is also there in this movie, even if only for a minute.

DeBose kicks some serious a$$ and looks amazing doing it - total Superhero material.\n\nRussell Crowe plays the role of the Kravenoffs to perfection as the power-hungry Russian Oligarch with the least bit of effort and is fun to watch.\n\n\n\n# Should You Watch It? Sure, Why Not?\n\nIf you watch this movie without considering the rest of the MCU, you should have a fun time with great action sequences, cool powers, and somewhat of an okay yet vanilla plotline.\n\n\n\n***Like this review?*** [**Subscribe**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/contact) ***to*** [**themoviejunkie.com**](http://themoviejunkie.com/)***!***",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI was completely taken aback after watching The Substance. I couldn’t stop thinking about the themes of beauty, aging, and society’s obsession with youth. I REALLY appreciate this film. I ended up making a video essay breaking it all down through the lens of body dysmorphia, mental health, and how this film mirrors real-world pressures on women.\n\nI also talk about the visuals, the horror elements, and why I think this movie is one of the most *disturbing and brilliant* critiques of modern beauty culture.\n\n**Here's the link if anyone’s interested:**  \n[https://youtu.be/DQxL5pkVbD4?si=no1FymE8yu-L3PRo](https://youtu.be/DQxL5pkVbD4?si=no1FymE8yu-L3PRo)\n\n**Title:** Elisabeth Sparkle and The Trap of Youth Obsession\n\nIn my video essay, I dive into:  \n– How Elisabeth’s transformation parallels real-world beauty standards  \n– The symbolism of “The Substance” itself and the price of eternal youth  \n– The horror as a reflection of body dysmorphia and external validation\n\n**Here's a short excerpt from the video:**\n\n\"The story of Elisabeth Sparkle is all too familiar. In an industry that prizes youthful beauty above all, Elisabeth faces an unyielding truth: Hollywood loves women who look young and fresh. When she can no longer meet these superficial standards, she becomes dispensable, unworthy of attention or respect. To regain her place, she consumes “The Substance,” which is essentially a potion that transforms her into the stunning and youthful Sue. However, the allure of physical perfection comes at a steep price, as Elisabeth soon finds herself trapped in a new body that demands constant upkeep and obedience to society’s whims.\"\n\n**I haven't posted in over 8 months so Youtube isn't really pushing out my video :( Would genuinely love feedback or to hear what others took away from the film.** This one got under my skin in the best/worst way.\n\n  \nAlso happy to discuss the ending or other symbolism if anyone wants to dive deeper.",

    "selftext": "I don’t know who needs to hear this, but *Jurassic Park* is STILL an absolute banger of a movie.\n\nI threw it on last night for nostalgia’s sake, expecting a fun ride and maybe some cheesy '90s effects. But holy hell — it’s still incredible. The practical effects? Still terrifying and believable. The CGI? Honestly better than half the stuff that came out last year. That T-Rex scene in the rain? Chills.\n\nSpielberg really struck gold with the mix of awe, tension, and just enough science-y talk to make it feel grounded. And the cast? Jeff Goldblum stealing scenes left and right, Laura Dern being a queen, and Sam Neill’s hat game is elite.\n\nAlso, the soundtrack. John Williams just doesn’t miss. That main theme hits and you’re instantly 10 years old again.\n\nIt’s wild to think this movie is over 30 years old. If you haven’t watched it in a while, or somehow never have (???), do yourself a favor and queue it up.\n\nAnyway, just wanted to gush. Anyone else rewatch it recently? Does it still hit for you too?",

    "title": "I saw Snow White today. Here's what actually happens, what it actually looks like, and why and how Disney failed this story (not for the reasons you think).",
    "selftext": "[When Walt Disney said](https://aletteraday.substack.com/p/letter-53-walt-disney-1966), \"I don't believe in sequels,\" he meant that he believed in always \"looking for new ideas and new stories.\" He always wanted to \"move on to new things\" and look for \"new worlds to conquer.\" He specifically said it would be dumb to try to \"top dwarfs with dwarfs.\" His successors should have followed their founder's philosophy. But they betrayed it and created a bad movie as a result. But the sad part is, the Disney company's bad movies still make bank by virtue of being made by Disney, so this movie isn't failing because it's bad but because of a campaign of racism and misogyny triggering a mass Asch Effect -- it's not failing for the reasons it deserves. And that's depressing. But Disney has had sleeper hits before. If the *Snow White* redo had actually been good, it would have found staunch defenders against its unjustly negative reputation for all the wrong reasons. But it's not, so it didn't. So the campaign of racism and misogyny succeeded because of Disney's lack of effort and reliance on the fact that their movies don't need to be good, their audiences will pay to watch anything. Well, for the first time, the world's hate was stronger than Disney's greed -- one evil has defeated another. It should not have been this way.\n\nI still believe the Disney redos just make money because parents feel safe taking their kids to see them. None of them have improved on the original, and most of them are downright poor movies. They're not new adaptations of old fairy tales made to stand on their own -- they're an insult to animation and storytelling. Their mission is to redeem stories by telling them in the acceptable medium of live-action instead of that vulgar, barbaric, low-class medium of animation and by checking off all the boxes for proper messaging at the cost of telling a good story without worrying about every single line being a lecture on or demonstration of morality. Using a story to depict a message in a creative way is no longer allowed. All creativity has been sucked out of these redos, and it's so frustrating to see them rake in cash and set records while superior books and movies and tv shows get less or no recognition because they weren't made by a famous company with a famous name. This trend deserves to end. But why did it have to be ended by another evil force?\n\nWe all know the reasons the racists and misogynists hate this movie and made it their goal to ruin Rachel Zegler's life because of the talking points Disney obviously gave her. She promoted the film as a feminist redemption for that horrible, misogynist old film, as she was no doubt instructed, but instead of assuring feminist women they would like the movie, it just inflamed antifeminists into fighting back. But why? Why did Disney fail so hard in its mission to spread feminism and other progressive values?\n\nBecause Disney's heart wasn't in it. They don't actually care. It's not actually important to them to teach people to be more generous or leaders to be merciful or women to be strong. They just throw in whatever messages the chart says are popular. They only tried to make a feminist movie because the chart says women want to watch feminist movies now. But since their heart wasn't in it, the movie that was made with this mindset completely failed. Disney violated its founder's directive not to try to top dwarfs with dwarfs, not because they genuinely care about using a history-making film to teach modern values, but out of sheer greed.\n\nThis insincerity is why the *Snow White* redo looks like 2 films smashed together. It doesn't actually look like they made a film with only the 7 human bandits, then, after the backlash started, filmed a bunch of new scenes with CGI dwarfs. Instead, it comes across as trying to pander to 2 completely opposite belief systems: the backwards conservative extremists who think women should be sweet, gentle, and innocent; and progressives who believe women should have the same right as men to be strong and independent. Instead of committing to a good message and saying \"Screw it!\" to evil people who only want evil messages, or even coldly committing to one message that was calculated to be the more profitable, Disney tried as hard as they could to get money from both sides, and when you try to please everyone, you please no one.\n\nAlthough Rachel Zegler's performance, both acting and singing, is superb, Snow White is a textbook Mary Sue. She's sweet, she's kind, she's brave, she's beautiful, everyone loves her, everyone persecutes her, everyone wants to protect her, everyone respects and follows her for no reason. She's the perfect combination of all antiquated feminine virtues cranked up to 11... but she's also a born leader, a determined plucky heroine, fearlessly standing up for herself and the peasantry! It all comes across as making sure she appeals to both parties, and the result is absurd. She has to be everything Sasha's mom ranted about how unfair it is that women have to be in *Barbie* \\-- too strong, and the conservatives will complain, but too sweet, and the feminists will complain! Every second I watch her, I'm not invested in her story -- I'm just aware that I'm watching writers trying to please EVERYONE. The result is that the character who once again is not allowed to be a human being on her own merits but a role model for little girls is thus telling little girls they have to aspire and try to be perfect -- if you're perfectly feminine and sweet and graceful and friendly, you can be a strong, independent leader!\n\nSame with the plot. Gotta keep all the plot points of the original to please the conservatives who think the past was perfect and hate change, but also need a politically correct plot with a perfectly manicured, politically correct message. So we have the befriending the dwarfs plot and the joining a rebellion with the bandits plot, and none of it makes any sense when put together.\n\nWhy do I say all this? Well, here's what I saw when I went to see the movie.\n\nSo the very first shot of the movie is... a hedgehog. I'm not kidding. They redo the storybook opening from the animated version, but this adorable little hedgehog is sleeping on top of the book, so when other small animals like squirrels and chipmunks come to open it, they can't. They have to push this hedgehog weighing down the cover off so they can get the book open to start this Disney story. There is so much symbolism there in retrospect, I do not have time to unpack it. I will say, though, I think the hedgehog is the best CGI creature in the film. The others -- the birds and furry animals -- look weird. The eyes look way too big, and something about them (or maybe the eyes is all it takes for this) just feels uncanny. But since quills don't have the same texture as fur and his eyes are normal-sized, the hedgehog looks perfect, and the detail and texture on him looks amazing. So, yeah, not a fan of the CGI animals in this film with that one exception. *Enchanted* used real rats and birds, why couldn't this movie just do the same?\n\nThe film proper starts off with Snow White being born in a carriage trapped in a snowstorm... and I can't believe how pretty and put together the mom looks just after giving birth in this scene! Seriously?! I thought that trope was long dead! There is NO excuse for depicting women like that just after giving birth anymore!\n\nSorry for that - that just REALLY pisses me off. Anyway, we then get the one good song in the movie -- \"Where the Good Things Grow.\" Some of the lyrics are anvilicious and contradictory, but other than that, it's an awesome song I genuinely like listening to. Same for its reprise at the end. The contradictory part is that the title and lines about planting seeds and bounty imply this is a farming community, but the song also explicitly establishes that the kingdom is wealthy because of all the precious gems they mine, which would make them a mining town, so why does a song about all the beautiful gems you mine and how prosperous they make you constantly reference that this is where \"the good things grow\"? (By the way, the gems in this movie look like plastic, they don't look remotely real or pretty, but that's not a big deal. They also seem to be as common as dirt and come out of the ground polished and shining, just like in Equestria, but the kids won't care about that.)\n\nAfter the opening song ends, the film relies on a narrator to explain how the queen died and the king remarried and the evil queen took over and how evil she is, and that's when the film's substantive troubles that you can't overlook start.\n\nFirst, how do you handle the heroine's father marrying an evil woman to become her evil stepmother? There are plenty of ways to do this well. You could make the dad an abusive jerk, like his new wife. You could make him an idiot. You could do what the animated *Cinderella* did -- he wanted his daughter to have a mom, so he married a woman from a respected family with daughters of her own, assuming that meant she would be a good mother to his daughter, too, and being tragically very wrong. This film... gives no excuse. Snow White's parents are depicted as perfect, kind, loving people... and then after his wife dies, the dad is shown meeting this new woman and being so swept away by her beauty that he marries her. Did she enchant him? Suggested but not explored. All you had to do was NOT make the dad a saint, and this would have been fine. You can't make a character a saint and then have them do something so dumb and disturbing. Alternatively, blaming a woman for changing a saintly man into one who does bad and/or stupid things, making everything he chooses to do her fault, is problematic in so many ways and not at all feminist.\n\nSecond, the backstory where actors do things on camera while the narrator tells us all the bad stuff the queen did is SUPER rushed (like all narrator openings in these Disney redos, like *Beauty and the Beast*). She somehow tricks the kingdom into going to war, which is how she gets rid of the king, turns all the men into soldiers, and starts hoarding all the gems for herself. Is the king held responsible for going off to fight in this war we're meant to think is fake? Nope, he's a victim. Had the film shown he was being mind controlled or something, he *would* be a victim, but it doesn't. It's all clearly being rushed to check off the \"Establish who's the villain and why\" box.\n\nThird, the queen upends the previous utopian system of share and share alike and replaces it with her stealing the bounty from everyone for herself, not making everyone believe they're better off each looking out only for themselves. By seizing more power and beefing up the royal guard, she makes the government bigger. Big government bad -- weird message to combine with the progressive message about sharing and valuing people over profit.\n\nThat brings me to one of the biggest contradictions in this movie -- this utopia where everyone shares everything in common still has a hereditary monarchy. How the fork does that work? All the townspeople are fine with sharing everything while the royal family has more than everyone? If someone tells me this is a viable, real, common economic and political system, I'll believe you. Tell me. Provide examples. Please. Because it looks completely unrealistic or at least illogical to me. Kids won't care, of course, but you can't expect people old enough to vote to want and strive for something without making it seem realistic and actually achievable.\n\nFourth, in their haste to check off all the boxes of things they need to say happened, we're never shown HOW, like how the queen was allowed to turn Snow White into a servant. Yes, there a million plausible ways that could have gone down, and we get to see NOTHING of it. The queen made her a servant, that's it. No development, no exploration. You know, the kind of things you could logically do in a remake -- develop things only hinted at or briefly mentioned in the original with more depth. Nope.\n\nThis montage is also when we see someone cutting off Snow White's hair, but the shot takes place in a vacuum. No context, no build up, no aftermath, it's just a random shot while she's still a young girl. So, no, that does not explain why the adult Snow White's hair looks so bad to so many people (I personally just think it looks out of place; the original has that haircut because it was all the rage in the 20s and 30s -- no need to keep it in a version made almost 100 years later). It's not the queen forcing her to keep her hair short and badly cut. Okay, maybe it is, but we don't get to see that! Or even be told that. No development of ANYTHING shown in this movie -- just show it, check the box, and move on.\n\nThere is a cool transition shot from the young to the grown Snow White, followed by the scene where she meets Jonathan, where you can hear the conflict between the two writing goals as clearly as if you were there in the writing room. \"We've got to depict him as a thief to show that criminals are good people and how bad things are. Oh, but we can't let kids think stealing is okay or parents think we're telling their kids stealing is okay!\" So they write ridiculously unnatural dialogue debating the morality of stealing in an oppressive regime to emphasize why it's okay now but not for you kids watching!\n\nWe also learn that Snow White is unaware of how bad things are for everyone in the kingdom and that she believes the queen just doesn't know how bad things are and would want to help everyone if she knew. Now, is there anything odd about an abuse victim thinking they're abuser is a good person? No. Is there any indication that is what's going on here? No. It just comes across as completely illogical. Snow White has lived a life of misery as a servant yet is shocked the queen is just as cruel to everyone else as she is to Snow White. Snow White is not depicted like a realistic abuse victim who believes she deserves it and struggles with accepting the way she's treated is wrong. They did not take that realistic approach. They don't have to (Harry Potter didn't, either), but that means you can't explain this inconsistency as the thoughts of a realistic abuse victim.\n\nThen we get the dinner scene between Snow White, the queen, and Jonathan. This would have been the perfect opportunity for us to get some good, juicy interaction between the evil queen and the heroine we NEVER see interact in the original. But it's just more morality debating. Every line between humans in this movie is a lecture and lesson or debate on morality. No exaggeration. All we get is Snow White advocating for goodness and the queen being mean and refusing.\n\nThen \"Waiting on a Wish\" starts. It sounds great in a vacuum, but it starts off weird in this context. She starts singing in the throne room, not at the wishing well... despite the song starting by being all about the wishing well. I'm also gonna say, \"waiting on a wish\" is weird wording. Waiting for a wish to be fulfilled makes sense -- \"waiting on a wish\" does not. You're waiting to be told or shown what you should wish for? And how is it empowering to singing about how you're waiting for a wish to be fulfilled anyway? So lot of illogical lyrics. but sounds great except for the \"ECHO ECHO ECHO\" lines.\n\nSo Jonathan gets tied up, but Snow White releases him because no guards are guarding him. Okay. So this act apparently makes the mirror tell the queen Snow White is more fair than she. Which makes this the perfect opportunity to discuss 2 more major problems with the plot.\n\n1. The movie seems to be trying to argue that true beauty lies within, that physical beauty is augmented by virtue. Nothing new about that. But they chose to make the conflict about greed, not envy. So mixing in a message about true beauty doesn't fit. It could, but they don't bother to, they just mention it twice with no exploration and no connection to anything else going on. They don't develop this moral at all, so the times the mirror says it feel totally random. The story and conflict have absolutely nothing to do with inner beauty. You want to make that a theme, great, but you have to actually do that, not just shoehorn in statements about it.\n2. The film tries to center around wordplay using the word \"fair\" -- fair as in beautiful and fair as in just and equal. As literally everyone has pointed out, this makes it absurd that the mirror ever said the queen was the fairest, since it's interpreting both meanings of fair as being the same (the fairest is the most beautiful). If the mirror was using inner beauty as criteria, the queen would have been last. And, of course, why would the queen care about being the most just? This wordplay only make sense if the mirror is a trickster like *Gargoyles*' Puck who was messing with the queen the whole time -- \"Oh, you meant fairest? I thought you meant fairest.\" The writers didn't bother to integrate the wordplay of fair and fair or the moral about inner beauty into the plot -- they were just checking off boxes once the statements were made.\n\nSide note: What's wrong with having a villain motivated by envy? The queen being obsessed with being beautiful doesn't make your message \"Beauty is everything\" -- it makes the message \"Only bad people think beauty is everything.\" In any event, if they wanted to focus on the evils of greed and not the evils of envy, they should have committed to that, but, nope, have to try to throw in what EVERYONE wants to see without properly blending it. Check, check, check.\n\nThe magic mirror scene leads to the first scene in the movie that actually made me groan out loud (there were only, like, 4 other people in the theater) -- the scene between Snow White and the huntsman. I agree with the Youtuber I can't recall who suspects that scene was cut where the queen pretends to agree with what Snow White was saying earlier and, to lure her into a false sense of security, let her put on her nice dress and sent her out to pick apples so they could bake apple pies for the villagers like she wanted. (Changing from picking flowers to picking apples is probably the only good change in this movie.) But all we actually get is Snow White now in a fancy dress happily picking apples with no explanation.\n\nBut that's not what made me cringe. What makes this scene so horrible is the two characters' interaction when he almost kills her. In the original, Snow White is TERRIFIED and screams like anyone would if someone much bigger and stronger than you pulled a knife on you, while the huntsman is horrified by what he has to do and so consumed with disgust that he can't go through with it. You can feel how much pain and agony he's in during the encounter. But in this version, Snow White *barely* reacts, just saying \"Why?\" with no change in expression. Can't show a woman afraid -- that's antifeminist! And the huntsman just screams through gritted teeth like he's mad, or like he's having a seizure. None of the emotion from the original scene is there at all. I truly cannot imagine how this scene could have been performed *worse*.\n\nBut, surprisingly, it's followed by my favorite scene in the movie. In a vacuum, the scene where Snow White runs through the forest looks and sounds GREAT! No complaints about it. The problem is, it doesn't end. It just... stops. In the original, Snow White collapses and sobs after she escapes the forest -- understandable for someone who knows the ruler wants her dead and is now homeless. But she stops, feels ashamed for breaking down (even though she shouldn't), cheers herself up with a song, reassures herself she can still survive, and starts thinking about what she needs. In this version, she meets the animals with no dialogue, no scene of calming herself down and rallying herself, and no plan making. It just cuts to them walking to the dwarfs' house for no reason with no dialogue. And then she just breaks into this empty house and goes to sleep -- no mistaken conclusion that it belongs to a group of orphan children who could use her help and that's why she sticks around.\n\nWell, it's now time for... the dwarfs. I was hoping they would look better than they did in the trailers or that you get used to them over time. Nope and nope. They look HIDEOUS. I don't get it -- you make them CGI because you think casting little people to play dwarfs is offensive, but you don't think making dwarfs look uglier than Paramount's first Sonic design is offensive to real dwarfs?! These designs make no sense. Who the bad place thought these looked good? At least Paramount only had 1 horrifying CGI monstrosity in its original movie -- you have to look at 7 in this movie!\n\nDoc is the only dwarf whose personality I like, by the way. Everyone else is just boring. Dopey is given an arc about finding the courage to talk because mute people aren't allowed to just exist as characters who don't need to be fixed. Grumpy, everyone's favorite in the original, is made to hate all humans, removing the anti-toxic masculinity message of his character and the subplot of him bonding with Snow White. And there are multiple lyrics where a dwarf says \"I'm X!\" and the others all reply \"We know!\" Can't allow kids to make those connections for themselves!\n\nOnce the dwarfs come home, the biggest, most glaring flaw of the movie is how little connection you feel between the characters. You don't feel like anyone forms strong bonds or friendships or grows close or should care a lot about each other. Snow White and the dwarfs meet, they allow her to stay. Even though we watch her teach them how to clean their house after they trash it during a fight, I don't feel like they've become close like in the original. Snow White and the 7 dwarfs sharing such a big scene now should feel like an improvement, like their relationship is getting more focus, but it somehow doesn't. Maybe it's because both sides did WAY more for each other in the original. Snow White cleaned the entire house and made them dinner, the dwarfs gave her a home. Here, Snow White's not allowed to cook or clean because that's not empowering (as a survivor of a toxic household, I can tell you, doing chores for yourself and cooking feel VERY empowering), and she leaves after only staying one night. I honestly have no idea why they kept this plot. They changed it to the point where conservatives can't stomach it, so they can't expect it to please that side, and progressives wouldn't care, so who is it there for?\n\nThe changing of the pig's heart to an apple is also confusing. I can't fathom the thought process behind that. If the thinking was that a pig's heart in a box is too scary for kids, then why did you include the box and the order to bring back Snow White's heart at all? Why would the queen demand her heart and then not actually check the box before asking the mirror? Honestly, the existence of the mirror makes her asking for the heart as proof unnecessary anyway, so you could just cut that out with no plot hole. But they keep it and have the huntsman put an apple in the box? Why would he bother to do that? The whole point of using a pig's heart was to fool the queen -- an apple obviously isn't going to fool her! What--why--how--who-- Where did this come from?!\n\nIn the original, it's at this point that the queen decided, well, if you want something done right, you've got to do it yourself! Here, she sends out a bunch of soldiers first to add some swordfighting and horse riding action in the woods after Snow White joins up with the bandits and her love interest. Fairy tale heroines doing some swordfighting in movies is nothing new -- see *Ever After* and *Snow White and the Huntsman*. But that would upset the misogynist faction, and we want THEIR money, so gotta keep them happy, so no swordfighting for Snow White despite her repeatedly saying she wants to fight.\n\nThis is also where we get the absurd song \"Princess Problems.\" Jonathan, you know she's been treated like a servant for years AND that she's on the run because the queen wants to kill her! Did this song come from a much older draft with a much different backstory for Snow White? Because Jonathan accusing her of not having real problems makes zero sense in context. I've had people try to tell me he meant something else, like how he doesn't like her outlook on the world, but that has nothing to do with \"princess problems!\" It's just a dumb song that doesn't fit the plot.\n\nThe forest fight scene is followed by Confusing Change #2000-something: Doc is not a doctor. I dare you to find ONE kid who watched the original or this version up to this point and thought that. Seriously, find me ONE kid who did not treat Doc as doctor while playing with toys or friends. And it's pointless because he heals Jonathan anyway. Oh, I forgot to mention the dwarfs' pointless magic hands. I somehow got in my head that they have gem-finding powers, but I don't recall the move actually saying that when their hands glow. In any event, that could have been used to say they have healing powers or the like if you wanted them to heal Jonathan without Doc being a doctor. And I don't see how these changes could be important to ANY potential paying audience group, so I have no idea what the motive behind them was.\n\nThe scene after Jonathan is inexplicably healed off-screen did show me I was right about one impression I got before watching the movie, though. When I heard that the setting was a king goes missing, the kingdom is taken over by an usurper who turns everyone into their army, forcing the princess to flee into the woods, where she falls in love with the leader of the rebels, I thought, \"That sounds more like Sally Acorn than Snow White.\" And I was right! That's exactly what we have here! There's nothing wrong with Snow White's and Jonathan's love at first sight plot if you accept love at first sight plots are acceptable in certain settings, though it is odd that romance is so taboo in new Disney movies and love at first sight is completely off-limits. So its appearance here, played so straight, feels very weird. This is why stories of a rebellion against a tyrant are better as a series than a single film -- you need time to show many battles and your couple falling in love at a realistic pace. Here, in spite of all the extra action they want to add, they only add about a day to the 2-day long plot of the original. You not only have to check every box, you have to rush through each one!\n\nIt's such an odd sensation when a movie is so desperate to rush through its required plot points AND, at the same time, okay with constantly interrupting the plot. The queen's new villain song adds nothing to the plot and makes no sense because it relies on that fair vs. fair wordplay that isn't properly developed. There's no indication that the queen was obsessed with being seen as a just, fair ruler, so singing about how all she does is fair makes no sense. Plus you've got Gal Gadot talk-singing the whole time... it's just a terrible scene. The scene where the queen makes her potion and poisoned apple is inferior to the original, too (shorter, less dramatic, visuals and effects that aren't as cool), but fine on its own. Thank Odin they didn't make the hag CGI -- I don't want to imagine what that would have looked like.\n\nActually, while Gadot's performance as the queen never looks natural, I like her performance as the hag a lot more. Her using the locket she stole from Jonathan to gain Snow White's trust as a nice touch. Her story about offering the princess an apple because she remembers the apple pies her parents used to give to the villagers works. I think the scene would have worked better, though, if they'd been sitting down eating and chatting happily rather than under the urgency of needing to go save Jonathan. Snow White was packing other food when the hag showed up -- there's no reason why she would have taken a bite of the apple at this time. The original gets more points for giving Snow White a reason to bite the apple, but this version gets extra points for the queen rubbing it in for Snow White as she \"dies.\" (Though I do wonder why everyone believes her statement that the king is dead. Based on the final scene, she was telling the truth, but there's no reason in context for anyone to think she was.)\n\nEverything after the poisoned apple is where the deviations from the original are at their worst. There's no exciting chase scene ending with the queen's gruesome death, no heartbreaking wake, they don't build her a coffin or even put her on a bed but on a rock, and she's asleep only for either a few hours or a few days. They linger so long on the dwarfs crying as she lies on this rock, as if they honestly think you'll find this as sad as the heartwrenching gut punch that is the original, and it just feels so awkward because there is no comparison. The only nice touch is that a distant shot shows Dopey leaning on Doc's shoulder like in the original.\n\nThe awakening kiss is likewise devoid of any emotion. Yeah, they kept that in. Could have just gone with the original fairy tale where they carry her in the coffin, drop it, and the apple piece falls from her mouth. They instead included a line in their earlier love song where they both ask the other to \"wake me with a kiss\" if they're dreaming, which is creative, I'll admit, but if you think consent is an issue here, no, that doesn't solve it. I don't think a despairing kiss to a girl you believe is dead counts as violating consent. Afaik, giving someone who has just died a good-bye kiss is not an unheard of practice. The prince obviously wasn't trying to take advantage of her for sexual pleasure, he was *devastated*. He leans down and cries after he kisses her. But if you think that was creepy or weird or wrong or a combination thereof, no, giving consent ahead of time doesn't solve that. That's why consent apps can't be used in court -- a verbal No after the fact cancels out prior consent. So they made consent an issue and solved it in a way that's not a solution at all. I really don't understand why they didn't just bypass this all together with the Brothers Grimm version of her waking up.\n\nSince the kiss and waking up isn't the final scene of the movie, it can't be given the attention it got in the original or feel as cathartic and happy. Now, we have to go back to the castle to... stare at each other and stiffly give lectures on morality. Yeah, everybody rallies themselves for a big battle to take back the kingdom, and it never happens. Characters planning to fight to the death only to end up talking it out instead is nothing new and can be awesome, but that's when the two sides are supposed to become friends or allies instead of enemies. That's not what's happening here. The queen tells Snow White to kill her in an out of place scene that looks like they were checking off a \"You're just like me\" box despite never coming up before, then orders her guards to kill Snow White instead of doing it herself, and then we get that silly scene everyone has described already where Snow White gets everyone to change sides by saying their names (and reveals some people in that alleged utopia lived in poverty, but this isn't done to imply \"Oh, it wasn't as perfect as it looked,\" it's just another inconsistency).\n\nI do like a Snow White story ending with someone smashing that mirror. As a fan of *The Picture of Dorian Gray*, I approve of the queen causing her own death by smashing the mirror. But whatever points the scene gains from those elements are lost by the mirror saying Snow White has now achieved the inner beauty that definitely makes her fairest of them all (so the queen had more inner beauty than everyone but Snow White? You're forking kidding me!) and by how Snow White looks while watching. Yeah, she arrives in time to watch the queen's death by magic, but because it's antifeminist for a woman to show fear, she just has a blank stare on her face the whole time, and then looks at her reflection in a way that looks like it's implying she's next and will soon grow to feel the same way the queen did and use the mirror for the same purpose. I am 200% sure that was NOT the intent.\n\nThat dissatisfying climax is followed by everyone bowing to Snow White. Except, unlike Mulan, she did nothing, so this feels as empty as every other scene in this movie!\n\nAnd to keep the emptiness up so as not to turn off half the audience, the final dance scene must be Snow White's and Jonathan's wedding, but actually saying that would be antifeminist, so it's never actually called that.\n\nFrom start to finish, you can feel how afraid this movie is of disapproval in every single scene. Every awkward line, every blank stare, every underdeveloped plot point, every refusal to say something out loud betrays a mortal fear of someone not being willing to buy a ticket if they say, show, or do the wrong thing. The result is a bunch of characters debating and lecturing on morality in mostly good-looking costumes on beautiful sets. And that's simply no fun. Show, don't tell -- that's a vital rule to follow no matter what your message is. But you can't expect a company that doesn't actually care about the message to care about delivering it effectively.\n\nOh, and the last shot of the movie is that adorable hedgehog. If the attention given to this hedgehog is just a coincidence, the Muses were clearly having a lot of fun. Definitely more fun than I had watching this movie. If I wasn't cringing, I was usually just bored.\n\nSo why is it so depressing that a genuinely bad movie failed? Because it failed for the wrong reasons. Disney's other preachy, pedantic, boring redos still made bank. There's no reason this one shouldn't have, either. It's not the worst -- I haven't seen the *Mulan* redo, but that one definitely sounds like the worst. *The Little Mermaid* redo bombed only because it had such a sky high budget -- it did way better than this film. This film failed not because it's the worst but because Disney got both arrogant and more clueless. They turned the progressive messaging up 100x in both the film AND the marketing while still courting the racist, misogynist audience. This led to the backlash from racist, misogynist audiences being worse than before and the movie being so bad that supporters of its messaging and of its lead actress couldn't promote it as a good movie.\n\nTo truly resonate with audiences and keep them coming in, a film needs to have heart, not just empty preaching. Good messages deserve good stories, and good stories deserve good adaptations. *Snow White* has some good music and good visuals, but that's it. It deserved so much more and so much better than it got from Disney. Disney has become their own worst enemy, which is helping other evil to thrive. Only time will tell which path DIsney takes from here.",

      "Thank you for taking the time to write such a long and well-articulated review!   \n  \nI can’t say that I agree with it entirely, though, as I genuinely enjoyed the movie. I'm not saying it's without flaws (in fact, I believe it's vastly inferior to the original animated film, as I feel is the case with most live-action remakes), but I do think it has its own charm, especially the music. I'm also a huge fan of Rachel Zegler and admire everything she does.\n\nI personally never felt that the movie was trying to tie together feminist and anti-feminist views, though that may have been the case, since this is Disney, after all, and they were probably trying to appeal to as broad an audience as possible, as you pointed out.   \n  \nI wouldn’t attribute the movie’s box office failure to a single issue, but rather to a mix of factors (many of which have already been discussed at length): the controversial marketing, the hate campaign against Zegler (which, of course, I find completely abhorrent and dishonest), the poor critical reception, and ultimately, Disney remake fatigue.\n\nAnyway, I'm glad I saw it. I think there are some genuinely good things in it, even if I understand and respect all of your points.\n\nCheers!",

The fact they made a tamil movie like this is actually risk taking in my opinion. The whole plot revolves around the patriarch of a family passing away. But, the person dies with a “hard” situation. Thrown into a “stiff” situation, the immediate family must do whatever it takes to hide this hilariously weird situation. “Perusu” has a “big” idea that will possibly “stick” for future adult comedies in tamil cinema to be more creative with the mature humour. The double entendres are creative here, showing that the “pen is mightier than the sword” in terms of effectively being a “hammer” for a plot point. This is definitely a story you would see in an english film, so seeing it in a tamil format is a “humongous” surprise. In terms of the movie’s quality, it sort of wanes in terms of effective quality at points, sometimes searching for the next “pole” point in terms of hilarity utilizing this situation. What the movie should’ve done more was focus on how this weird situation was bringing out family secrets and quirks. But either way, I give it a positive review for simply staying true to its conviction to the “massively” absurd plot device. A comedy that is definitely not a family film!",

    "selftext": "On one hand I see men on the internet a lot complaining about how naked men are shown too much in movies now . If the common perception is that women were shown more than men previously in the past  then why complain? It is only fair to balance it out. On the other hand I see women complain more about women being shown more now and in the past, but men’s chests have always been shown more, I think butts were always shown equally and genitals have been equally hidden for both.\n\nI guess I am confused on which is actually true. They say women were shown more from the 60s to the 80s but were they really if you compare chests to breasts, butts to butts, and genitals to genitals? Is the main difference that female pubic hair was always shown more?",

Topless women shown for significant runtimes will change the age ratings so thats why they arent shown in movies as often. I recall reading data on topless women seen more often in european and UK movies and TV dramas but not sure that still accurate.",
      "Women have been \"naked\" (however the particular society defines them) more than men throughout the entire history of human creative expression. Some cultures and time periods have had wider ratio gaps than others, but women ultimately out do the men. One of the oldest carved artworks ever discovered was of a buxom woman's torso, butt, and legs. No feet. No head. No hands. Just breast, belly, butt, and legs. Very round. Very full. Humanity has been obsessed with T.A. all the way back to the earliest B.C.",

The male search produced 14 thousand something results and the female search produced 22 thousand something. It pissed me off at first then I noticed that just during the silent film era and pre code era alone, there were at least four films that I know for a fact had male rear nudity that weren’t listed. I am wondering if IMDB is a bad search to use since people probably notice female nudity more and mention it in writing more.",
      "I strongly disagree with you. Women weren’t more naked during Greece or Rome or the Middle Ages. They were covered more than men were. After the Middle Ages women were still expected to be modest up until some time in the 20th century. This is only for Western Civilization but there are plenty of other cultures where women were expected to be more modest than men as well for most of history. Please give me examples of how it was considered okay for women to be naked more than men historically in most cultures including Western Civilization.

      "**\"And if that is the case it pisses me off that men complain about a double standard now.

(not saying that happened), but we are not the people of the past. We are the people of today. We should be judged based on what we do now, not based on what others did before.\n\nSo, for instance, my mother may have grown up in a time where it was nude women all the time, men covered up. but that doesn't make my complaint any less valid, of so much male nudity today being distasteful, and that it's weird that women are almost always covered now. I think my concern is just as valid as my mothers.\n\nI mean, it's almost like me saying as a guy, I was sexually abused, but then someone says, :how dare you complain because 3 girls got sexually abused down the street.",
      "Your question was not about nudity in real life. Your question was about nudity in movies. Have there been more depictions of nudity of women more than nudity of men in movies? \n\nI proclaim that more women have been nude because to me \"movies\" is just one of the recent forms of visual creative expression. Photography. Illustrations. Painting. Sculpture. Wood Carving. Etching. Stereoscopes. Picture books. They're all precursors to movies (and television). Now humanity has video games, holograms, and A.I. generated imagery. Check out the roster for the video game Marvel Rivals. One gender is more sexually objectified than the other, and you'll need only one guess to figure out which. \n\nWhen it comes to our media, the cultures always find ways to sexualize the technology... and the sexual entertainment inevitably leans to more depictures of women than men. Emphasis on entertainment. I'm not typing about media that was created to commemorate events, maintain historical record, or depict leaders and deities. Instead, I'm am typing that the same track record and trends of media sexualization has the same overall track record and trends as \"the world's oldest profession.\" \n\nI fully acknowledge that I cannot effectively prove my theory within a forum that prevents me from offering visual evidence and examples. Honestly, I would probably have to make a full collegiate lecture to prove my theory. I have a bachelor's degree in visual arts and an associates degree in visual communication. My course included art history, painting, sculpture, film lighting, film editing, photography, and computer imaging. I hope you'll trust that I am trying to cram nearly a decade of education into a handful of paragraphs (at 4:30 am EST). \n\nLong story shorter, there have been more depictions of female nudity in movies than male because women have historically more sexualized for media entertainment than men. Just go to YouTube. Search for A.I. generated fantasy entertainment, humanity's newest form of \"movies.\" You will quickly see which gender is far more sexualized than the other.",
      "Actually for most of Western Civilization women covered up more than men. This idea that women are supposed to be more naked than men only started in the 20th century. It makes sense to me for women to be more covered since their nudity impacts men more than nude men impacts women.\n\nIn regards to what you are saying about focusing on here and now, it depends on how young you are. If you are a man who was alive in the 70s and 80s when apparently it was always women shown in movies and you enjoyed it thoroughly then I think it is hypocritical to complain about the reverse now since you experienced both situations, especially if you think we should go back to “ just naked women “. \n\nI don’t think either sex should be nude in movies to be honest. Above when I was talking about men being less modest than women for most of Western Civilization, that doesn’t imply that it was necessarily okay for men to be naked for most of that history either. But it wasn’t until the 20th century that it became acceptable for women to start showing more skin (not necessarily private parts). Then it wasn’t until the late 60s that female nudity was suddenly considered okay while male nudity wasn’t.\n\nSo when these men complain about nude men in movies now, if they have an attitude that we should go back to just naked women in movies in exchange for that, then I have little sympathy for their opinion on that. I find it very hypocritical. \n\nMen looking at naked women isn’t anymore okay than women looking at naked men. Most of history shows this and was against it. \n\nAlthough as I said before, there is the question of whether women really were shown more before in movies. What was shown more? Their chests weren’t shown more. Butts were pretty equal. Genitalia wasn’t shown on either. What was shown more exactly?\n\nAs a side note, I find your comment a little interesting about women always being naked during your mother’s time and men always covering up. I am not sure that that was ever the case. If you are talking about movies after the 60s, women were suddenly naked more but not all the time and men were shown naked too but apparently not as much ( but that is up for debate with my last points above).\n\nDo you as a man who is upset about recent male nudity think it is okay for women to be naked instead? I hope not.\n\nI am wondering if the main issue with male nudity being shown now is the penis being shown. I understand that complaint because it isn’t like shaved vulvas on women were ever shown before. So if they wanted to make male nudity equal to female nudity then I am not sure what they would actually show more of. They already show their chests more. I think butts were always equal but if women’s butts were shown more that isn’t right. Either show both equally or not at all. Genitals on either used to never be shown and shouldn’t be. I think maybe pubic hair on women was the only thing shown more and I don’t think that is okay either. Just don’t show nudity on either sex.\n\nAnother thing I need to add is that if women really were shown naked more before in movies then it isn’t like men can’t still watch that old stuff from the 80s or 70s. Unless these men are advocating for the female nudity in those old movies to be deleted, then they shouldn’t be complaining about male nudity now.\n\nSo my main argument is that while I think it can be debated as to whether women were actually shown more before…..the overall consensus seems to be that they were in these discussions and I think it is hypocritical for men to acknowledge that they were and that it was okay while also complaining about men being shown more now. Either complain about both or accept both.",
      "Even in art depictions it isn’t true that women have always been shown more. Look at all the cultures that have had penises on display everywhere. Greek and Roman statues showed men more nude than women. A lot of other cultures were similar. Paintings depicted nudes equally at least through the 1500s or 1600s. I am not sure about after. When we are talking about the age of movies I  am not sure that women have been more naked either when you compare each part shown on each body. Mens chests have been shown more than breasts. I think butts have been shown equally. Genitalia of both sexes was never shown. Bush on women might have been shown more but not sure if that is nudity. Men complain that recently penises are being shown too much while vulvas aren’t. If you are talking about porn or what you are now talking about with AI I see how what you are saying might be valid.",

    "selftext": "https://youtube.com/shorts/S6eLkiBNUt4?feature=shared\n\nVeera Dheera Sooran: Part 2 - 10/10. Finally a solid solo venture for Vikram! Its been years, but we finally have a very solid film that utilizes Vikram’s acting abilities and meshes it with a great overall film. “Veera Dheera Sooran: Part 2” is a very familiar and formulaic story that we have seen done to death in tamil cinema. If movies like “Chandramukhi,” the “Aranmanai” series, and the “Muni/Kanchana” series helped influence and helped catapult the horror comedy genre in tamil cinema, then “Kaithi” helped catapult the visceral action drama genre. And its pretty evident that VDS Part 2 is a direct descendant of Kaithi. Like Kaithi, this too is a mostly happening at one night story, and it follows a former gangster (played brilliantly by Vikram) who must get out of retirement in order to help a person that has a significant connection to him from his gang past. Layered and brilliantly executed cinematography and direction wise, this movie is one of those movies that focuses on itself in a self assured manner. It goes at its own pace, and its pretty grounded (for the most part) in terms of its action and pacing. There’s some creativity here in terms of the long shot sequences, as they help amplify the tension and plot of the movie. Vikram is great as always, and has allowed the story to fully take over the importance here. He gets his times to shine, but its all in accordance to the plot. SJ Surya is really great here too, as he is grounded like the film, doing less of the over the top antics he has become accustomed to, and playing his role with a cold calculation like Vikram. The rest of the performances are great as well. Cinematography is excellent here too, and you can tell they have done their best in terms of showcasing this story in an interesting manner (the long shot sequence near the end of the film is nothing short of brilliant). Not sure if they will ever get to make the prequel/sequel (due to the box office not being super high), but its awesome to see a director like Arun Kumar pushing the boundaries on the prototypical commercial format. I hope tamil cinema continues to be experiment with the stereotypical commercial format!",

    "selftext": "Thank you Khalid Ikka for creating such a wonderful movie and decided to release it as Vishu special after my graduation. A Vishu special by Khalid Rahman, in short, oru vibe padam. He is unarguably can be considered as one of the best youth director in malayalam. Sprots drama movie deals with story of friendship around a bunch of fellows who joined in a boxing club after failed in plus two exam in order to get grace mark and issues they deals with during state boxing championship and how these incidents helps to create and strengthen their emotional bound. Even though movie begins as a comedy sports drama, it follows a thallumala type of format gradually as the story goes on. How these incidents , like I have said, helps to create an emotional bound between them and create an aim for them in their life is what the impact of the movie rely upon. Not only they succeed in creating but also they successfully portrayed the conflicts can also be seen as the positive aspects of the movie. Fight scenes are brilliantly portrayed and technical department did a great job. Nasleen's performance reminded me of prime Nivin pauly throughout the movie, he did a great job. Performance deserves appreciation, they brilliantly pulled their roles. Each and every person did their best, they went into god mode, it is impossible to mention one name while talking about performance. Not better than thallumala, but fight scenes also can be seen as core theme in the movie along with friendship, just like Thallumala. This is going to be an ultimate winner of Vishu in 2025.\n\n  \nFollow me on Letterboxd : [https://boxd.it/67lJb](https://boxd.it/67lJb)",

    "selftext": "**Swipe Right for Suspense.**\n\nEarly 2025 continues the trend of taking the rom-com formula into unexpected places. *Drop* marks yet another new direction for the genre this year—this time, instead of merging it with slashers, sci-fi, or absurd action, it’s blended with the tension of single-location thrillers like *The Call, Phone Booth, Grand Piano*, and *Locke*, with shades of *The Invisible Man* (2020) woven in. At its core, though, it’s still a genuine rom-com with charismatic leads who have great chemistry, and it’s the slow-burning sweetness of their relationship that ends up being the film’s most compelling element.\n\nDirector Christopher Landon, still riding the goodwill from his inventive and fun *Happy Death Day*, continues his streak of elevating scripts of dubious quality—though in this case, it’s just mediocre, not nearly as rough as *We Have a Ghost*. Here, he brings a Hitchcockian flair to what is essentially a story about two people trapped in a restaurant over the course of a single night, with escalating stakes unfolding almost entirely through app notifications, close-ups, and shifting body language. It’s the kind of setup that could’ve easily felt uninventive or stale, but Landon keeps it visually dynamic—using clever shifts in perspective, subtle lighting cues, and tension-building inserts to maintain momentum and unease.\n\nRead my full review at https://reviewsonreels.ca/2025/04/12/drop/\n\n**My Favorite Scene:** When the protagonist finally figures out who is behind it all.",

    "title": "Movie Review - Good Bad Ugly",
    "selftext": "https://youtu.be/PoKAtmS-4SQ?si=nIAuz-sUa8WWoNme\n\nGood Bad Ugly - 6.5/10. This is a perplexing watch. On the one hand, as Adhik Ravichandran had promised, this is strictly a fan service film. From the countless references, callbacks, and allusions, to the cameos, to the easter eggs in here, this is strictly for fans of Ajithkumar. And if you’re a fan of his, you will have a blast here. You have photos and looks from Ajith’s past which they’ve added in here for context to Ajith’s character’s. You have songs from his past films, jokes and titles used in dialogue here too. As an experiment of showing how far one’s fandom could go in film form, then this film excels! Going into this film, you need to understand that wholeheartedly. Ajith is having a ball here, having a fun time and just playing up this character to another level. He’s having fun, which seems like something he hasn’t been able to do wholeheartedly in recent years. Arjun Das is having fun here too, playing a Looney Tunes like villain that is equally over the top to the film’s atmosphere. The Simran cameo is fun, and its quite a funny scene too! This is strictly a movie that is designed and created out of one’s stardom. And that’s where the “bad and ugly” begins. Stardom and references shouldn’t be the main driving factor for a film’s narrative. Its okay to make a fan service film (“Petta” and “Vikram” are great examples of quality fan service), but even within a fan service movie, you should remember that things could go overboard. This film will alienate anyone unaware of Ajith’s filmography or if they’re not a hardcore fan. If you are a casual film goer, then this is a head scratcher, cause it will feel like a Youtube mashup tribute. I’ll give this movie a pass because Adhik did unabashedly say and express his desire to make a film of this nature for his beloved star, and never shied away from that fact in interviews. He never said he was reinventing the wheel. But, in the future, when Adhik reunites with Ajith (which is inevitable with the money this movie’s making), then hopefully for that film, they will go back to making something more plot inclined. I personally loved “Mark Antony,” and though that movie is similar in tone, that film still tried something within its over the top absurdity. The sci-fi element helped the plot so much, making it a little more palatable and interesting. I think this is one of those “lets get this out of my system” films for Adhik. Maybe he has an excellent film up his sleeve for Ajith, but he probably wanted to get past all his desired references to Ajith’s filmography in this film so that their next collab is strictly business. As a fan experiment, this is excellent! As an overall film, its not great, but as a somewhat Ajith fan, I liked this to a certain extent!",

    "selftext": "I know most critics aren’t being kind to this one but I thought it was one of the best Die Hard wannabes! Here is my review\n\n\nAh, the Die Hard wannabes. The noble subgenre of “What if Die Hard… but on a [location] or with [this character]” has seen its fair share of success over the years—and it’s crossed paths with the U.S. president more than once. The ’90s gave us the action classic Air Force One (Die Hard on the President’s plane), followed by 2013’s guilty pleasure siblings White House Down and Olympus Has Fallen. Now, the formula returns with great success in Patricia Riggen’s incredibly thrilling and surprisingly rewarding G20.\n\nBoosted by a stellar cast, a smarter-than-expected script, and a barrage of well-executed action sequences, G20 doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but it nails what makes this kind of film work: a vulnerable protagonist, overwhelming odds, a ticking clock, and a villain with a tightly crafted plan. There’s hiding, sneaking, scrambling, and slowly figuring out how to turn the tide before it’s too late. The mold is so effective that if done well, it just works—and here, it absolutely does.\n\nRead my full review: https://reviewsonreels.ca/2025/04/09/g20/\n",

    "title": "A Minecraft Movie (2025) Review: A Film Exclusively Made for Tiktok Teens and Video Game Kids",
    "selftext": "I’m surprised that *A Minecraft Movie* didn’t come sooner. The game has been one of the defining parts of video game culture for the better part of a decade or longer. Generations have grown up playing it. Parents who played it as teenagers are now teaching their kids about it. It is the single biggest phenomenon in the gaming world and the highest selling video game of all time. And at its core, it’s a game about mining and building with square blocks. No goals, no objectives, just survive and build.\n\nSo it surprises me that, in an era where huge swaths of Hollywood budgets go towards developing films based around massive IP, that no one thought to tackle Minecraft until now. And if the early box office numbers are anything to go by, it would seem like this was an easy slam dunk for Warner Bros. and Universal Pictures. It’s a shame though that there is little semblance of actual good filmmaking present in the film that was almost guaranteed to make hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nThe plot, if you can call it that, follows a group of four individuals- washed up gaming champ Garret “The Garbage Man” Garrison (Jason Momoa), siblings Henry (Sebastian Hansen) and Natalie (Emma Myers), and real estate agent/traveling zoo owner Dawn (Danielle Brooks). The four live in the small town of Chuglass, Idaho. When they discover an orb from Minecraft’s overworld that opens a portal to that dimension. The four are rescued by Steve (Jack Black) during a zombie attack at night and they venture to find a new way home. Meanwhile, the evil piglin queen Margosha plots to steal the orb and use it to take over the Overworld.\n\nThe big issue with *A Minecraft Movie* isn’t that the plot is inherently bad. It’s generic as far as video game adaptations go – We’ve seen this “real people enter video game world” plot rehashed in films like *Tron: Legacy* or the recent *Jumanji* films. But the real issue here is that the execution of the story is quite poor. The film has 5 credited writers and 3 “story by” credits. That’s obnoxiously too many cooks in the kitchen. As a result, elements feel half baked, characters are wholly one note and their forced arcs are undeserved, and conflicts wrap up as quickly as they are introduced. There is an extended intro that explains both what Minecraft is and the origins of the characters of the story that takes far too long for a film about a video game. Nearly the first 25 minutes are spent just setting things up. For a 2.5-hour movie, that’s not awful. When the film is a hair over 90 minutes, that’s nearly a third of the whole film.\n\nNow, given some of these faults, its obvious that *A Minecraft Movie* is going to be a huge hit. As it stands it will easily be the highest grossing film of 2025 so far, and quite possible will end the year with that mantle. Much of that can be contributed to the Gen Z/Gen Alpha demographic that has turned out in droves to see it. Theaters are packed with children and teenagers who grew up with Minecraft are seated. It’s time that Hollywood discover that children and teenagers will turn out for a film they care about. It’s IP that was made for their generation, not their parents. And I am glad that a new generation of people are discovering that the theater can be a place to be.\n\nWhat I wish is that the filmmakers and director Jared Hess, most famous for *Napoleon Dynamite* and *Nacho Libre*, had decided to make a good movie as well.\n\nAt the end of the day, there’s quite a list of things that this film attempts to accomplish but doesn’t. The characters of the story are pretty solely one note, without any actual earned development. Garret’s only feature is he’s a washed-up video game champ. Henry is just a nerdy kid who wants to be cool. Natalie is just trying to get by and care for her brother. and Dawn is just a single real estate agent with side hustles to get by. The film does nothing to expand on these characters or dive into what makes them who they are, nor does it care to.\n\nHess doesn’t ask for much from the talented pool of actors here. The best performance belongs to Emma Myers as Natalie, who actually brings some good moments to the character. I’ve been a fan of hers since her breakout with Netflix for *Wednesday.* She gives what I believe the best performance of the film. The problem with *A Minecraft Movie* is that most of the performances are just so over the top it gets to be too much. While I enjoyed Jason Momoa and his commitment to the bit, it can get annoying fairly quickly and Jennifer Coolidge delivers the laughs in her side plot.\n\nBut the worst offender of the main cast is Jack Black. His performance is just so far out there it borders on totally ridiculous. It feels at times that he was able to do just whatever he wanted with no borders. It just needs to be seen to be believed.\n\nYet there are some things that the film does well. I especially appreciated the dedication to the visuals. While the stunt effects were pretty poor, the visual landscapes of the Minecraft overworld were quite impressive. I also appreciated the commitment to creating practical sets and props that fit the Minecraft world. It makes places like the village feel totally alive and the characters present in the scenes. As a fan of the game, it was fun to actually see the props of things I’ve used in the game appear in real life.\n\n...\n\nRead the full review and see our score here: [https://firstpicturehouse.com/a-minecraft-movie-2025-review-a-film-exclusively-made-for-tiktok-teens-and-video-game-kids/](https://firstpicturehouse.com/a-minecraft-movie-2025-review-a-film-exclusively-made-for-tiktok-teens-and-video-game-kids/)",

But it also punched me in the gut in a way I didn’t see coming. \n\nThe main character’s life is kind of on autopilot — looks good on paper but feels hollow. Then her mom dies and leaves her this old list of goals she made as a kid. And the catch? She has to actually do them if she wants her inheritance. Sounds like a gimmick, but it ends up forcing her to confront how far she’s drifted from who she used to be. \n\nAs someone who does not really go out their way to try new things, outside my own \"comfort zone\", because its what I'm used to, this movie made me realize that its never too late to pursue your dreams and aspirations regardless of your age, we just need a little courage...\n\nIt’s not some deep arthouse movie, but it’s honest in its own way.

    "title": "\"Don't Look Away\" (Reelabilities Film Festival) Documentary Review",
    "selftext": "This April (2025), I watched the screening of Don’t Look Away, a 2024 documentary short directed by Joseph Vitug Lingad. The documentary follows Corey Taylor, a man in his thirties pursuing social stability with the hope that society will embrace and see him past his craniofacial deformity. A special thank you to the Reelabilities Film Festival for allowing me and my husband to experience our first Reelabilities film (hosted at the Marlene Meyerson JCC Manhattan), and to my Professor, Julia Rodas, for exposing me and many others to the side of film and literature where disability is acknowledged and embraced.\n\nCorey Taylor seems to live a reality that many can relate to: experiencing the on-going insecurity of not feeling like enough, not only to the general public but also to a future partner. On top of walking on egg shells in his adolescence that provoked an “ever-present threat of rejection” (Garland-Thomson’s Extraordinary Bodies) in public, Corey had recieved rejection from those he felt were safe spaces like many from his former online role play group to people as close as his sister, who as a young teen over a decade ago, couldn’t believe that there was a non-disabled girl that was genuinly interested in him as much as he was in her. When the siblings were young children, Corey’s sister recalls the days he’d come back from a facial reconstruction surgery thinking his face was finally “normal,” just to look in the mirror and cry. Over the years, his 40 to 50 reconstruction surgeries didn’t give him the satisfaction he’d been looking for though his most recent procedures have been more to his liking. \n\nWhat I loved about this documentary was that Taylor’s personality wasn’t superficial; he wasn’t hiding the fact that he wanted to look different from how he’s looked the past 30-some years. Regarding work opportunities and especially dating life, he says, “ It angers and frustrates me because I know I have so much to offer.” In Extraordinary Bodies, Garland-Thomson says, “Perhaps most destructive to the potential for continuing relations is the normate's frequent assumption that a disability cancels out other qualities, reducing the complex person to a single attribute.” A great percentage of people may glance at a disabled person and unconciously label them, making it unnecessarily difficult for the disabled person to have a casual conversation without the non-disabled person already establishing prejudices, narratives and barriers.\n\nDisabilities don’t always miraculously disappear; sometimes they do, but many other times, a disabled person will appreciate life while simultaneously acknowledging that it can be a mentally, socially, financially, and/or physically taxing process to navigate it. I also think of the documentary Code of the Freaks, in which an interviewee mentions the misrepresentation of disability in film that has distorted countless viewers’ perception. The interviewee argues that films have done a great disservice to the disabled community by catering to the non-disabled crowd, resolving their viewer tensions by allowing the disabled character to be cured, institutionalized (Rain Man), killed-off by a non-disabled (Of Mice and Men) or take their own life (The Elephant Man). In the same vein, exposing the sick undertones against disability in film, Paul Longmore, author of Screening Stereotypes says “Whether because of prejudice or paralysis, disability makes membership in the community and meaningful life itself impossible; death is preferable. Better dead than disabled.”\n\nThese kinds of endings are outright denials of a world that cannot accept the fact that disabled people exist, can speak for themselves, and do appreciate their life. Corey finds himself to be charming yet he doesn’t feel handsome. He loves acting and wrestling and doesn’t mind being typecasted as a villain in someone’s film because he chooses to use his craniofacial deformity to his advantage. This is not, as Longmore mentions, a narrative that paints an ugly picture of disabled people by non-disabled people, but rather us seeing a great example of a disabled person having the autonomy to do as he pleases with his life. \n\nThe truth is that no one on earth can 100% speak for Corey except himself, and some accept their differences more than others. Some have absolutely hated and/or been embarrassed of their physical appearance, like Taylor or Zack McDermott as he recalls his first psychotic break in his New York Times article “The Madman Is Back In The Building.” It looks different for everyone. I’m grateful my husband was able to join me in watching Don’t Look Away amongst a supportive community at the theater, as we left with a greater urgency to speak up for a population that has been harshly misrepresented and misunderstood.",

It draws attention to the ongoing struggle with ableist representation and the impossibility of political purity when people just need to live their lives. 💙"

    "title": "\"An Unquiet Mind + Tess: Living with OCD\" Film review: Intimate Glipse to OCD or Exploitation of Disability?",
    "selftext": "This film is an absolute rarity: it portrays OCD not as a punchline, horror story, or tragic death sentence, but as a nuanced, deeply personal condition that real people live with—flawed, full of fear, and yet still deserving of joy, love, and humanity. It actively deconstructs harmful tropes that have defined disabled characters for decades.\n\nDoes it break free from the stereotypes?\n\nCompletely—and intentionally.\n\nIn stark contrast to the recurring tropes laid out in Screening Stereotypes—like the villainous \"cripple,\" the suicidal quadriplegic, or the maladjusted, bitter disabled person—An Unquiet Mind + Tess offers a deeply human, respectful portrait of people living with severe OCD. It actively rejects the idea that disability is a form of symbolic or literal dehumanization.\n\nVinay and Natasha are not shown as burdens or threats. They’re not criminals plotting revenge (à la Doctor Strangelove or the “Hookman” from Hawaii Five-O), nor are they social pariahs whose only escape is death (Whose Life Is It Anyway?). These characters live, despite enormous stigma, fear, and emotional pain.\n\nWhat the film does show is the real psychological weight of stigma—and the damaging effect of media that continues to suggest OCD is just about quirky germaphobia.\n\nHow does the film do justice to disability?\n\nIt tells the truth. Not the polished, pity-laced truth we often get in \"dramas of adjustment,\" where the disabled person only becomes lovable after an able-bodied friend slaps some sense into them—but a more raw, painful, and empowering truth.\n\nThis documentary:\n\nDepicts the complexity of OCD: including Harm OCD, Postpartum OCD, and intrusive sexual thoughts—topics usually too taboo for honest conversation.\n\nCenters the voices of disabled people instead of speaking about them.\n\nHighlights the harm of cultural stigma, especially in communities where mental illness is seen as weakness or a spiritual failing.\n\nDoesn’t end in death: In contrast to films like The Elephant Man or Nevis Mountain Dew, the people in this film choose to live, seek therapy, advocate for awareness, and—most importantly—find connection.\n\nWhat stereotype does it still follow, if any?\n\nWhile the documentary avoids the most damaging tropes, it might still reinforce the idea that only the most extreme or dramatic forms of OCD deserve visibility. Intrusive thoughts about harm or pedophilia are valid and need representation—but we also need to normalize more “everyday” experiences of OCD to avoid implying that suffering has to be intense to be real.\n\nThere’s also a subtle dynamic where the neurotypical character (Connor, Vinay’s friend) serves as a kind of “lens” through which the audience is gently educated. It’s well-handled, but it still echoes the common pattern of nondisabled characters being the facilitators of insight and compassion.\n\nWhy this film matters (in a bigger cultural sense):\n\nToo often, as the critical theory outlines, media reinforces our fear of disability by portraying it as synonymous with loss of humanity, control, and social value. This documentary directly challenges that narrative.\n\nIt says: you can have terrifying, intrusive thoughts... and still be a good person. You can be misunderstood, even by your partner, and still deserve love. You can live with OCD, not be “cured,” and still live a full, meaningful life.\n\nNo suicides. No “emotional slap in the face” from an able-bodied savior. Just real people, struggling and surviving on their own terms.\n\nFinal Score: 9.5/10\n\nThis isn’t just a good film—it’s a much-needed corrective to decades of tired, tragic, or terrifying disability tropes. Highly recommended for anyone tired of media that says disabled people are better off dead, monstrous, or emotionally broken.\n\n  \nwhere to watch film: [**https://reelabilities.org/newyork**](https://reelabilities.org/newyork)",

    "selftext": "Neatly written gangster movie is accompanied by its raw and heavy realistic portrayal of events and situations and high moments which is organically created through its screenplay. The main thing attracted me in this movie is Choi min sik's characterization and his performance. He leads a very complex and sometimes even more unpredictable character and the way he did that character was the soul of this movie along with its screenplay. The character he played is portrayed as a dumb and drunkard in the initial stages of the movie, but then gradually that character became complex as the story goes on. It is a slow process and his unpredictability nature also makes that character even more complex while the screenplay progresses. I am not saying that this is as complex as Dark or Inception, I am talking about characterization here. It is a complex character and the way Choi min sik did was deserves appreciation. This is why I think he is considered as legend. Story is raw as realistic, begins with a comedy track the story became even more serious as the plot progresses. I am again not saying that I never means it as complex as dark or inception and I mean the movie had layers in case of the characterization. Anyone can simply watch and don't think this movie is complex and I only meant the protagonist is a complex and unpredictable character. Movie is definitely a worth watch if you like to watch a gangster crime drama and you will like even more if you like to watch a korean movie. It goes through many things such as politics, power, rivalry and chiefly corruption. Remember that the events are realistically portrayed one and that itself makes the movie a slow paced one. Watch it if you have patience.\n\nFollow me on Letterboxd : [https://boxd.it/67lJb](https://boxd.it/67lJb)",

    "selftext": "https://youtu.be/RRu_yVdwizU?si=WUkI7Ck9TPP1sLhQ\n\nWarfare - 9/10. Got to see this at an advanced screening! So, if I were to be completely honest, I would say that “Civil War” is the stronger film. However, in terms of throwing you into the throughs of things, “Warfare” is the much stronger film. This is a chamber war film (think of this as A24’s “Black Hawk Down,” as we are stuck in this home that the soldiers are in as it is getting attacked. From start to finish, we see these soldier’s in an almost “fly on the wall” perspective. Everything here is based off the memories that the surviving soldier’s had from this event, so it gives the film a sense of harsh reality. We get to see them right before their mission, as they act foolish while watching a song, and then see them go into the mission. As the mission goes, we see the slow process that a war campaign might be. We see them taking turns monitoring the outside, sharing water, having random chit chat, doing exercises, and just biding time as they sit in this home and watch. And as soon as the first grenade is thrown and the first shot is taken, chaos breaks loose. We see the going get tough and how these soldiers anguish with the extremities of war. One of the big things for this film is that it doesn’t shy away from the imagery of war. You see the effects of a bomb attack on soldiers’ bodies (bloodied and opened up). You see trauma right then and there mentally, as some over compensate and try to throw in bravado to mask their fears, or, become shell shocked. If Civil War focused on the people on the sidelines of war, then this focuses on the focal points of personnel. My one drawback for this was that it felt like a movie of two scenes (the beginning song portion and then the long war campaign). But that’s the point of the film so I guess it did what it intended to. Will I ever see this again? Probably not, but, its a solid war film nevertheless.",

    "selftext": "Warfare, co-directed by Alex Garland (Ex Machina, Civil War) and former Navy SEAL Ray Mendoza, has one clear goal: make you feel like you’re inside a combat mission during the Iraq War. Think the beach landing in Saving Private Ryan, but stretched into 90 relentless minutes inside a crumbling house in Ramadi.\n\nThe premise is bare: a group of American soldiers—played by exceptional, committed actors who underwent intensive military-style training for authenticity—invades a civilian home and uses it as a temporary surveillance base. There are no backstories to lean on—no one carries a photo of a lover back home or reminisces about their life as a teacher. What we learn about these men comes only through how they respond under pressure: who freezes, who charges forward, who holds it together.\n\nThe film’s characters are direct representations of real people, with the credits showcasing each actor beside their real-life counterpart. But under Garland’s direction, they’re nearly faceless by design. The idea is clear: these soldiers could be anyone. That’s conceptually powerful, but it also creates distance. Films like Saving Private Ryan, The Hurt Locker, or Lone Survivor showed that immersion and character development can coexist. Warfare chooses otherwise—and that choice limits it.\n\nRead my full review at https://reviewsonreels.ca/2025/04/10/warfare/",

    "title": "Stranizza D'Amuri (Fireworks) 2023 Review",
    "selftext": "I just finished rewatching Stranizza D'Amuri for the 3rd time, and I wanted to leave a scrambled review on the film. It was amazing. The emotion felt raw. I could feel each scene so intensely, and the love that starts building throughout the film is so pure. \n\nI wanted to leave a review less on the film and more on the content. I think that the film lays incredibly powerful social commentary on LGBTQ+ identity, especially centered on a fiction based on real events. Too many scenes felt intentionally context heavy that it feels like the author is making explicit the overt connections between social status, economic class and sexual identity. The groundwork begins in their setting--the richer protagonist's family lives in a single shack in a sleepy coastal town and can afford a dilapidated yet functional moped, while the poorer protagonist lives in his stepfather's apartment next to a rundown bar where the locals frequent and spend their time doing nothing. The social classes vary from a head honcho (Turi) who commands the simple men of the bar, to the abusive stepfather who cowers at the prospect of facing the bar-goers. The economic class is poor, all around. What's interesting, and I feel making a dramatic point in this story, is that everyone does *nothing*. Class becomes a specific vector for social critique in Stranizza D'Amuri. People who do *nothing*, gain *nothing*, become *nothing*. The protagonists are exempt from this rule because they, at the very least, have aspirations and motivation. The fireworks protagonist wants to make art with his craft--the other wants to move and actually live a life (he's imo in survival mode trying to figure out how to struggle through the world alone). This overt *nothing* is best exemplified by the protagonist's (sister/mother?) who lounges all day, listens to the radio, eats, plucks her eyebrows, thinks maybe 2 thoughts and carries on. To add, she could not care less for her youngest child, the protagonist's nephew (she has no visible relationship to him, as he's taken care of by the grandmother, and when the entire family goes to eat, the child won't even talk to the mother--he only looks at her with contempt). \n\nThat *nothing* makes the reactions to Gianni's sexuality all the more infuriating, a classic symptom of having nothing better to do, so you invent a whole social problem and give your life meaning. The sister/mother girl is the first to become insanely infuriated at the prospect that Nino has been hanging around a gay guy. I'll paraphrase her thoughts: *How dare you bring that boy into our home? He's been playing with my son. He could have been molesting him. How could you bring that horror to our family?* The basically dying father, who just toasted to Gianni's greatness, turns into a melodramatic killer when he finds out Gianni's gay. Interrupts their work by driving miles to get to Nino, yanking him from Gianni and taking him home to place him in a chair and interrogate him with his Uncle (who drove to the house to aid in this interrogation). My thoughts are: be for real--you're dying and the only one who's cared about that is your son and your wife; you're outraged that your son might be gay but what the fuck do you know so why are you overreacting; chill with the machismo since you're literally physically weak (a funny irony considering being physically weak is incompatible with Spanish machismo--I get they're Italian though). \n\nThe other protagonist's mother calls the other mother to confess her son is gay so that the other mother's son could be saved from that humiliation. Like what? It's so realistic because this is how stupid people are. As IF you would get ANY absolution from this situation? You think you're a martyr by confessing this information when the reality is that you're trading your own twisted notions of heteronormativity, fueled by absolute insecurity and jealousy (the mother, I think, broke down because she realized her son is finding both love and money, which meant he was going to move out. She crashes out when her boyfriend tells her this and said he will help Gianni get an apartment). Instead of being able to handle her feelings maturely (an unfortunate relationship: the class struggle with the immaturity complex), she dons her black nightgown and kills her sons future with that phone call. \n\nSocial status and economic class bear the twisted and incredibly malformed homophobia that makes the bulk of the mind stuff in everyone's head. For the rural, sleepy townsperson found in all corners of the world, there is no real discernible purpose for life: natural selection has crept into the workings of human adaptation, making it so this is the lived and inescapable reality for the rural man. And in that stunning absence of fulfillment, you find hate filling the void. Stranizza D'Amuri shows us that hate makes for frustrating situations where love can't sustain when unimaginable and artificial odds are stacked against you. ",

With a title this bold, and a concept that was reportedly born from the brain of *Hellraiser* creator Clive Barker, you might expect a twisted, genre-savvy romp—something that toes the line between early horror and kid-friendly comedy in the vein of [*Coraline*](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/coraline-movie-2009/) or *Gremlins*. Instead, what you get is an animated adventure that plays it safe, aiming squarely at the younger crowd but without enough bite to keep older viewers engaged.\n\nThe setup has promise: a meteor crashes into a zoo, turning most of the animals into zombies. The only ones unaffected? A few survivors who must band together to fend off the undead and reclaim their home. Among them are Dan, a grumpy mountain lion voiced by [David Harbour](https://cinephilecorner.com/cast-and-crew/david-harbour/) ([*Gran Turismo*](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/gran-turismo-movie-2023/), [*Violent Night*](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/violent-night-movie-2022/)), and Ash and Felix, played by [Scott Thompson](https://cinephilecorner.com/cast-and-crew/scott-thompson/) and [Paul Sun-Hyung Lee](https://cinephilecorner.com/cast-and-crew/paul-sun-hyung-lee/), respectively.

    "title": "The Order",
    "selftext": "As far as crime thrillers go, *The Order* is solid. All of the performances are first-rate, led by Jude Law and Nicholous Hoult. Director Justin Kurzel keeps things moving at a steady pace, mixing the investigative beats with episodes of violence. The movie is beautifully filmed by Adam Arkapaw, who received Emmys for his work on television shows *True Detective* and *Top of the Lake*. Although the film is thoroughly compelling and full of interesting characters, it never quite achieves greatness.\n\nThe problem is that the movie’s examination of the world of white separatists is much more interesting than the storylines involving the law enforcement officials. Other movies have used white supremacists as the bad guys before, depicting them as scowling hulks spouting racial epithets. *The Order* eschews those superficial treatments by explaining at length how people become aligned with white supremacist ideology and its mission, as well as why it's impossible to convince those people that their beliefs are fundamentally flawed.\n\nIn an effort to counterbalance the white supremacist aspects of the story, the filmmakers divide time with the law enforcement characters. Jude Law’s performance is the most interesting one he's given in some time, and he appears to enjoy playing a character who’s intense and damaged. But the movie avoids delving into his character beyond surface-level tics. His troubled history is alluded to on multiple occasions but remained frustratingly opaque. Law’s relationship with Jurnee Smollett’s character is also teased but forgotten when the action escalates. Tye Sheridan is fine as the baby-faced police officer, but his character is the same as any other wide-eyed young recruit in these sorts of movies.\n\nThe movie’s obsession with comparing Law’s grizzled FBI agent and Hoult’s white supremacist leader doesn’t yield much beyond a layman’s psychological insight. Both men are hard-charging, single-minded loners, but the movie needed to go further than highlight those commonalities for us. In the end, the movie basically shrugs while affirming one last time that “these guys are kinda alike”.\n\nStylistically and structurally, *The Order* seems heavily influenced by Denis Villeneuve’s *Sicario*. However, this movie doesn’t reach the same levels as *Sicario* because it repeatedly prevents the tension from building. Instead, it loosing steam every time it switches between the white power and the law enforcement worlds. *The Order* has all of the ingredients to be as propulsive a story as *Sicario*, but it never gets there because it doesn’t want the bad guys to become the stars of the show.\n\n*The Order* is a solid law enforcement thriller, featuring exceptional performances by Jude Law and Nicholas Hoult. Although I had issues with the movie’s pacing and focus, the view it provides of the world of white separatism is as gripping as it is troubling. **Recommended**.\n\n[https://detroitcineaste.net/2025/04/08/the-order-2024-review-and-analysis-jude-law-nicholas-hoult/](https://detroitcineaste.net/2025/04/08/the-order-2024-review-and-analysis-jude-law-nicholas-hoult/)",

    "selftext": "Espionage thrillers—or thrillers in general—thrive on making the audience feel like the protagonist: constantly threatened, boxed in, and scrambling for a way out. The reward comes when that character flips the situation through smarts, skill, and execution.\n\nThe Amateur had the perfect setup to deliver exactly that. Rami Malek returns to the spy world after playing the villain in the most recent Bond film—this time as a kind of off-brand Q turned rogue. He plays Charles Heller, a CIA cryptographer whose wife is killed in a terrorist attack. When the agency decides not to pursue the killers, he takes matters into his own hands and heads into the field seeking revenge.\n\nThe premise suggests a Bourne-like thriller, but with brains over brawn—a refreshing change from the usual muscle-bound spies (or martial arts specialists like John Wick). Heller’s arc as an office-bound codebreaker stepping into danger for the first time could’ve made for a grounded, intelligent take on the genre. But the film rarely lets his intellect shine. Despite his hacking background, his tactics never go beyond tropes we’ve seen countless times—fake passports, dodging borders—and only one moment (a clever escape from Fishburne’s Robert Henderson) hints at real ingenuity. It’s a thriller that moves through the motions without ever building suspense or payoff.\n\nRead my full review at: https://reviewsonreels.ca/2025/04/09/the-amateur/",

Christopher Landon returns to form here, with this “Non-Stop/Carry-On” meets the romance genre film. Its a chamber thriller, with it mostly happening in this restaurant, as a widow must do whatever it takes to keep her son safe as she gets threats and demands from an unknown airdrop threatener. The catch is: this all happens during her first date in years since her ex husband’s death. Its a standard and pretty straight forward thriller, and its one of those concept thrillers that will keep you engaged from start to finish. Landon veers away from the horror template here, as he goes for just a more straightforward thriller. It also begs the question: would this have been the tone for his “Scream 7” project? Sadly, we will never know about that. The performances are neat and straightforward, the story is very standard but directed well, and overall this was just a good and solid time. Meghann Fahy does a pretty solid job here playing the widow in peril, and Brendan Sklenar does a decent job here too. Nice heroes journey connection between the beginning scene and the end as well! Landon does a nice job of making this visually stimulating and making it dynamic to follow with the text messages popping up next to the character and all. But yeah, overall, this isn’t necessarily on the level of a “Happy Death Day” or a “Freaky” to be honest, but this is a solid thriller that will pass the time.",

      "The acting is not the best, the camera use is only for \"jump scares\" and most of the time it just becomes annoying because you won't be able to see anything when things are actually happening. The characters reasoning to keep filming is weak af, so it becomes weird that they keep the camera on for so long into their panic. Also, the chat is useless. Neither entertaining for us, the audience, or helpful for the streamers. The worst part is spending minutes in a still frame with a bunch of meaningless comments.\n\nBesides the streaming feature, the plot is not very interesting. A group of influencers go to a cabin to boost the owners business and show off the place for free. But they don't really do much besides showing the house and doing a campfire before things go south. The plot twist of someone trying to hurt them doesn't really hit because there's no tension built up for us to care about who is the killer among the cast. It happens and shortly later it's revealed who did it. And in the end everything resolves in a very sloppy way, as if none of the characters are actually smart enough of determined enough to do things, so the situation just awkwardly evolves into a bunch of bad decisions.\n\nFinally, what irked me the most about the movie is the sheriff. He's shown in a bad light at the beginning, stopping the main group car just because he \"knows\" they're going to be trouble because they're youtubers. And then when they call he comes all mad about receiving prank calls because of them, when it was just their viewers trying to help. All emergency calls need to be investigated and THEN police can fine the people for faking an emergency. It made no sense for him to keep saying he doesn't believe them and telling them to shut up instead of explaining. I get the point of the \"not the smartest cop\" character, sure, but it was the third time that I had to see someone discover the body to believe what's going on like this is freaking Danganronpa.",
      "It was Among the weakest of the influencer Livestream horror films and doesn't follow its own premise",
      "This film is definitely worth watching. Although the first 30 minutes might feel a bit slow or lacking, the ending is promising and makes it worthwhile (especially since it's open-ended). The story is thrilling, and I'm surprised it's not getting more attention. Honestly, it's a beautiful film, despite some production shortcomings. With a bit more refinement, it could be even better. Overall, I highly recommend it.",

    "selftext": "A point of exploitation in modern capitalist society told through an absurdist horror tale of a unicorn and a wealthy “CEO”\n\nEat the rich is a genre massively growing in popularity with which I have no problems. This latest installment is ripe with its message, and I’m chomping it down like a unicorn steak. Our film starts as an interesting world wherein a unicorn has been discovered, and we’re having fun learning more about it in a lighthearted atmosphere, all this until the second act, when there's an excellent tonal shift into a darker tale. The film slowly becomes more and more sickening and ultimately becomes a monster fueled by a less than adequate cgi splatterfest. Although throughout this film we are treated to dialogue between a very realistic 21st-century father and daughter, the latter with high principles only affording to have due to their privilege earned by a dad whos put morals aside to get by in this chew-up capitalistic world. Our heroes are joined by some lovable American billionaires, characters so well-designed that I’m quite sure I’ve met a few myself. The mom being the most infuriating, as she’s best portrayed with excellent acting from Téa Leoni’s end. Unfortunately, as it builds an intriguing atmosphere coupled with a tasty score, this is truly where our film peaks, as once we began to get into a more horror-filled area, I was left unsatisfied. \n\nUltimately, the third act is by far the messiest, with the CGI budget seeming as if it’s run out, a chase scene feeling like it’s out of a Disneyland ride, a whiplascious insertion of emotional weight that need not be and a lackluster scare factor. Personally, there were a few directing choices towards the end that I disagreed with and a few lost opportunities with some potential truly horrific routes you could follow, but in the end, leaving us with just a creature feature and a cast of characters that haven’t grown over the last 90 minutes.\n\nI’m the end while this movie was really enjoyable and the setup was quite unique with promising ideas, decent characterization and fun dialogue, Once the credits roll, you’ve pretty much realized that what you’ve watched was no unicorn, but merely a horse.\n\n\nPlease provide lots of constructive criticism!",

    "title": "Movie Review - The Ballad Of Wallis Island",
    "selftext": "https://youtu.be/hmu0jd-iCe4?si=giUaeKkb_YWA8Nd9\n\nThe Ballad Of Wallis Island - 10/10. Music means something to everyone, and it has differing meanings to everyone. In the case of this film, its meaning varies: it reminds a person of the happy times, relics of the past, emotional pain, success/failure, their ability to tell a story, their ability to connect to lyrics and the emotion of a song, and also the feeling of loneliness. This film reminds you that something as simple as your love for a musician’s work can mean so much more than another person’s fandom. Ballad of Wallis Island is a charming, meaningful, poignant and simple dramedy, which sees a rich island dwelling fan paying for his favourite music duo to reunite for one last show. But, this gig offers a little more than what everyone bargained for. The premise of the artists unknowingly coming to the island to play a show for just one person seems like something straight from a horror movie concept. In fact, one of the character’s ironically mentions the movie I thought (Misery). But here, the character is much like Collin Ferrell’s Banshees Of Inisherin character (but much more rhymey jokey). These are the simple films that need to be continuously made. I love big budget films as much as the next guy, but these are the films that help connect you to humanity and the simplicity that comes with everyday life and interaction. It really goes with the saying “one man’s trash is another man’s treasure.” In this case: the trash is equating to just another job opportunity for an artist, whereas the treasure is found for this lonely island man who just wants to reconnect to his late wife’s love for the music. We tend to forget that small actions and gestures go a long way for people. You might think you’re doing something simple, but that simplicity might have a beautiful complex effect on another person. And when it comes to music, it can speak volumes for many reasons. But if there’s one thing music universally can do, it is this: it can make you feel something. No matter how happy or jaded you are, you will feel something. And just like music, this film will make you feel a lot. A wonderful simple film!",

Life there is so far removed from what any European city-dweller, like myself, can imagine. The landscape is so vast, and so beautifully captured on film.\n\nNapoleon Dynamite encourages us to be eccentric. There are people who will quietly accept your oddities - or even better, love you for them. Each character is brilliantly crafted, casted and acted.\n\nFinally, have you ever seen a man dance that well? That's rhetorical - but no, you haven't. It's a sign of a good movie if you're left wanting to dance, and believe me, even the stiffest of souls will fancy a boogie after watching this.",

    "selftext": "I was born in the ’90s, so by the time I started getting into films, the name Martin Scorsese was already sacred. (Shutter Island was my first Scorsese film!) That’s why it’s hard to imagine Taxi Driver coming from a relatively unknown director with only a few small projects and one modest success to his name. At the time, it was a risky, uncomfortable film—one that needed serious backing just to get made. And yet, nothing about it feels like the work of someone still finding their voice. The control is remarkable, present in every shot and decision. Even the second act’s slow, meandering pace masterfully mirrors Travis’s growing isolation and gives the third act its weight. There’s nothing tentative about it—it feels like the work of a filmmaker who already knew exactly what he wanted to say.\n\nThe film follows one of the most iconic and bleak characters in cinema: Travis Bickle. Born from Paul Schrader’s personal crisis—a time when he was consumed by loneliness and existential dread—Travis has no friends, no family, and no meaningful work. He’s desperate for purpose but lacks the tools to escape his spiral. One particularly telling moment has his coworkers trying to pull him into a casual conversation. Travis replies with something generic, then retreats into silence. He’s a ghost in plain sight. He woos Betsy, a campaign worker, with quiet confidence—but takes her to a porn theater on their first date, completely unaware of how wrong that is. He sabotages every chance he has to break out of his routine.\n\nRead my full review at https://reviewsonreels.ca/2025/04/01/taxi-driver/",

    "selftext": "https://youtube.com/shorts/9r-hke7LE-k?si=SeaIyDTxT5SCESCC\n\nThe Amateur - 7.5/10. What if Ben Whishaw’s Q character became a Jason Bourne like agent? That’s the gist of what this film is. Throw in a John Wick crusade to avenge his wife’s death, and then you got yourself “The Amateur.” Got to see this in an advanced screening, and this happened to be a film I was quite excited to watch! This techno espionage thriller sees Rami Malek back in the thick of things as a lead, and he really embodies a desk based agency worker who wants to seek revenge. Knowing that his capabilities and abilities will have to rely on brains versus brawn, Malek’s character goes on a globe trotting mission to do what the CIA are not able to do for him. Leaving the agency and embarking on his crusade for justice, he also inadvertently causes a powerplay of sorts within the agency. This is the type of movie that used to be made so often, but now seems far and few between. Though its familiar and somewhat derivative, its the direction and performances that makes this so fun and interesting to watch. Its a crisp thriller which also ponders another thing to think about: on a crusade for revenge, how easy would it be to exact the same actions as the villains? In the case of Malek’s character, he realizes as his mission goes on that killing is not so easy, and it also takes a toll. Mentally, these agents who work these types of cases have to be less empathetic and must driven by a coldness towards their targets. Malek’s character surprisingly still finds humanity when he has an opportunity to kill point blank, which I found very fascinating. Its a welcome change in a film of this nature, as that proverbial switch we always see characters turn off/on is a lot more complicated than we think. Malek does get his justice, but with somewhat of a distance from the targets. Though this isn’t an all time classic or a film that will change the genre, its still a fun and thrilling enough watch!",

    "title": "Movie Review - A Minecraft Movie",
    "selftext": "https://youtube.com/shorts/l0_zV4XP9sU?si=jbBgGw4UHEiePPKn\n\nA Minecraft Movie - 6.5/10. I was literally wondering after watching that brilliant animated short directed by Jared Hess as to why he hasn’t directed anything in years. Napoleon Dynamite and Nacho Libre are so original and interesting visually. So I was kinda happy that Hess got a shot to direct again here (even if its for a pretty blatant video game adaptation). But you know what, this is the mark of a true director who sticks to his sensibilities because “A Minecraft Movie,” though not incredible or full of substance, carries with its surprisingly unique visuals and its insistence to just be a fun movie. This movie has no substance of greatness here, it just feels like a sugar rush fever dream on steroids. And ironically, that did the trick for me. As a person with no understanding or knowledge as to how the game works (apparently its the highest selling game in history), going into this with no preconceived notions helped. Here you have Jack Black in his Jim Carrey Sonic mode, being let loose and just being wacky adrenaline based energy to a 1000. Jason Momoa seems to have signed onto this just for the sake of having silly fun, and it seems like everyone involved just wanted to have a good time. Hess’ unique visual sense is on display during the live action portions, and because Minecraft has such a distinct look, I thought the generic story and idea was bolstered because of the creative visual landscape. Honestly there’s nothing here to write home about, but, if you’re looking for something that is just casual mindless fun, this would do the trick. Never felt bored while watching it too!",

      "Yeah, I enjoyed the movie a lot. I saw it in 3D. Like you said, I was never left feeling bored. The story was pretty good and the villager side story was pretty funny as well. The comedic interactions were pretty good and so were the Easter eggs, especially one in particular. I feel the hate is kind of forced, especially from what I experienced at the theater(which thankfully wasn't crazy). Everyone, kids, teens and parents all seemed to be having a good time and laughing. Kids were explaining to their parents what certain things were. I feel the bar was set when the trailers came out, and for me the movie surpassed it. If you go into it with a \"serious\"/closed mindset or expect by the book Minecraft, you will be disappointed. However if you have an open mind and expect a somewhat \"unserious\" adaptation of the game, you will probably enjoy it. I feel that being creative, adventurous and trying new things or ways is another \"point\" of Minecraft. I feel the cherry on top was after the movie was over and the lights turned on, you could hear kids telling their parents that they couldn't wait to get home to play Minecraft and try some of the stuff they saw. I feel that made the experience better."

    "title": "Stuck in love (2012)",
    "selftext": "I really liked this movie, but be ready for a very emotional movie. It hits well on the complexities of relationships, whether family/kids or love interests.\n\nBasically the main character are the dad (Bill), his teenage son (rusty), and his teenage daughter (sam). The kids are aspiring writers and Bill is a somewhat famous writer. He is still obsessed with his ex wife, she cheated on him at some party, walked out and stayed with the guy. Sam resents her mother cause she knows and saw everything that happened, she hasn’t spoken to her since the incident.\n\nErica (her mom) very much hates that Sam won’t talk to her. Seemingly because of what happened between her parents, Sam just looks to get laid and doesn’t want to get any emotional attachment and doesn’t do relationships/dates. Louie (sp)? A guy in one of her classes likes her and wants to really get to know her, she rejects him multiple times. She is freaked out and leaves once she realized they have the same favorite book\n\nOne day she notices Louie isn’t in the class and she wonders what is going on. She founds out his address and kind of hides to see what is going on in front window, she sees that his mom is in really bad shape and dying. She agrees to go on a date with him after she goes home for christmas. She is clearly scared of getting close to him cause she doesn’t want to get hurt, but you can see she does like him. On the date they do kiss and she admits to him she is scared of being hurt.\n\nBack to Rusty, Rusty has to read aloud a poem in class, it references the bad stuff going on in school but also the angel in his class (kate) which he obviously likes. She’s going out with this douchey popular kid at school. After class kate tells him she likes the poem, she probably already knew she was the angel in the poem. \n\nRusty decides to go to a party with his friend he’s not actually invited in, part of this is because he was pushed by his dad to have more experiences. He only gets let in cause he has a bunch of weed to share. Later on in party he goes upstairs wanting to just talk to kate but when he goes upstairs he sees her doing a line of coke in bathroom, he’s sad (she doesn’t see him during this time). \n\nAfter all this Kate gets into a bit of a verbal altercation which i assume at the time was her bf (not sure), he pushes her down and Rusty punches the guy that pushed her. Kate, Rusty, his friend go to car. Rusty drops him off, Kate asks if she can stay over at Rusty’s for the night and she does. His Dad eventually sees them on coach and asks who she is, his dad was reading his journal earlier (and rusty caught him), he teases him a bit about him talking highly of kate. A bit later Kate asks Rusty to stay with her as she’s in bed, she asks him if she was the angel he wrote about in the poem. He says yes and she initiates them kissing. They are clearly a couple after. She says he will be good for her.\n\nSam is getting her first book published and is doing a book signing. In it she gives Kate a glass of champaign having no idea about her drug problem. She gets hammered does coke and goes missing. Rusty is freaking out they eventually find her in a guys house and Bill beats up the guy. She goes to rehab, she eventually writes him a letter apologizing for everything that happened. She now realizes that no one can “fix” her but herself. \n\nLater on bill confides to sam that what she did to him he did to her years back. Sam is angry and feels guilt now for how she treated her mom. He cameback after 6 months and he promised her if she ever did that kind of thing he would wait for her and have a table ready for her. I forget if it’s for thanksgiving or christmas, anyways eventually she comes back after 3-4 years for one of the hollidays and they eat some food with louie there. Kate is invited but sadly never joins. It does seem she is getting better tho.\n\n8/10, emotional tear jerker ",

    "selftext": "**SPOILERS**Watching this movie, it is clear that it was funded by the Military Industrial Complex.\n\nThe excessive violence and gore is done to desensitize children to these effects, showing that we’ll likely go into a war soon.\n\nBesides this, there is even deeper symbolism that can be found in the movie.\n\nClearly, the villagers are meant to resemble Israelis. You can see this by their appearance and the peaceful villages that they live in. They also love emeralds.\n\nEverything is fine until the piglins come to attack them. The nether represents Gaza and the Piglins represent Palestinians/Muslims. This depiction is obviously derogatory, as they cannot eat pork.\n\nThe piglins want the orb (Jerusalem) so they go through the portal to retake it. But their land has been colonized by the Israelis.\n\nThey go through the portal in an event that represents the October 7th attack. In real life, Hamas members came in on parachutes, and in the movie the Hamas members (Piglins) come in on rafts carried by ghasts (basically parachutes)\n\nThe people in the movie represent the Americans. Jack Black is obviously one of the American hostages taken on October 7th. He is likely an American Jew who moved here from the “overworld” (Europe and America)\n\nJack Black is freed as a hostage and this is where the real propaganda comes in. Regular, everyday American citizens are stuck here. Now it is their job to defend Israel from its attackers. Working together with the Iron Golems (The IDF/Iron Dome defense system), the Americans help the Israelis.\n\nThey end up killing the villain, an old piglin woman who wears a hijab throughout the movie. Notably, she is also the only British character in the movie. This is a nod to the fact that they were the people who caused this in the first place.\n\nAt the end of the movie, the Israelis win after a violent and bloody battle and after recolonizing the land. The Palestinians are desolate and have nowhere to go. Jack Black goes with Jason Mamoa to pursue a gay relationship with him back in America and the Israelis presumably preserve their apartheid state by destroying all access to the nether. Perhaps they even annex the nether (Gaza) and turn that into settlements too.\n\nOf course, the Israeli villagers do not have all the land yet, and this can be seen from the woodland mansion, whose habitants probably represent Hezbollah or Iran. However, they seem to be getting there.\n\nBut the parallels are plain to see and only one message can be derived: Go and die for Israel and have no qualms young American! We’ve sent you to die in the middle east before and we’ll do it again!",

      "Very true! Succinct analysis",
      "Any other movies you've written reviews on?",
      "Wow. I honestly don’t know how you could see it that way.\n\nYou called this movie propaganda for the military-industrial complex. I saw something totally different. I saw a story that, intentionally or not, mirrors the truth of what’s happening in Israel—and does it surprisingly well.\n\nLet’s talk about the villagers. You say they’re colonizers. Really? Jews have had a connection to that land for over 3,000 years. Israel didn’t show up out of nowhere—we returned home. The villagers living peacefully, valuing emeralds, building lives—that’s what Israel’s been doing since the beginning. And like in the movie, peace only lasts until someone storms through the gate.\n\nEnter the Piglins. They’re portrayed as pigs—animals considered unclean in Islam and Judaism. But the bigger issue? Their leader wears a keffiyeh-style scarf, leads with brutality, and is willing to sacrifice her own people without hesitation. That’s not a random villain. That’s Hamas in a different font.\n\nYou point out they invade from the Nether. That portal? That’s Gaza. The invasion? October 7th. In real life, Hamas flew in on paragliders and slaughtered over 1,200 people. In the movie, the Piglins arrive on ghasts. It’s almost too on-the-nose. You want to call that propaganda? I call it a painfully accurate reflection of what happened.\n\nThen there’s Jack Black’s character—the hostage. You frame his rescue as some kind of manipulation. But there are Jewish-American hostages still being held in Gaza. This isn’t fiction—it’s still happening. Bringing hostages home is not propaganda. It’s justice. It’s humanity.\n\nNow, let’s get to the Iron Golems. They don’t fight until provoked. They stand still until the enemy strikes. That’s Torah. In Sanhedrin 72a, it says: “Ha-ba le’horgekha, hashkem le’horgo”—“If someone comes to kill you, rise up and kill him first.” This is not about violence—it’s about defense. That’s the heart of Jewish ethics. That’s what Israel lives by.\n\nAnd here’s something else I noticed: when it gets dark in the movie, zombies and skeletons pour out of nowhere. They’re not strategic—they just lash out. I saw that as a metaphor for the kind of blind, destructive rage that erupts during nighttime terror attacks—whether it’s suicide bombers, mobs throwing rocks, or indiscriminate rocket fire meant to harm civilians. It’s not calculated resistance—it’s chaos that breeds fear.\n\nAnd the dog? That was one of the most powerful metaphors in the whole film. At first, the dog is hostile—aggressive, dangerous, taught to hate. Just like people who’ve been brainwashed to believe Jews are monsters. But the moment the hero offers the dog a bone—an olive branch—the entire energy shifts. The dog becomes fiercely loyal. It’s a reminder that hate isn’t innate. It’s taught. And it can be unlearned when you show people who you really are.\n\nNow your final line: “Go and die for Israel.” That’s not analysis. That’s slander. The IDF doesn’t ask anyone to die for Israel. It asks people to protect the only Jewish homeland in the world from people who chant for its destruction. And Americans who support Israel? They do it because they believe in democracy, in life, and in peace—not war.\n\nAnd let’s be honest: the only people who are truly brainwashed are the poor Palestinians raised under Hamas’ regime, taught since childhood that Jews are the enemy. And it’s not just them—it’s the Islamist billionaires and terror-sympathizing organizations who subliminally fund schools and student programs in the West, pushing antisemitism under the guise of “activism.” They’re bringing people in on student visas to infiltrate campuses and sow hatred—not because of politics, but because we’re Jews. If it were Catholics or Buddhists living in that land, no one would care. But because it’s us, suddenly the world has a problem.\n\nIt’s never really been about land—it’s about hate. Jews are the smallest religious minority in the world, and we’ve been the scapegoat for centuries. Why? Because we stick together. Because we don’t bow. Because we thrive. Not just intellectually, but spiritually. We carry Torah in our bones. We carry truth. And that bothers people who have none of it.\n\nPeople don’t hate us because we fight—they hate us because we survive. Because we protect what’s ours. Because we shine even in exile. And when we come home, we do it with strength and soul.\n\nThis movie didn’t brainwash kids. It accidentally told a version of the truth—one where defenders wait until they’re attacked, where the most dangerous enemy is the one who turns on their own, and where peace is possible if people stop digging holes they don’t even understand.\n\nSo no, I don’t think this is propaganda. I think it’s the first mainstream movie in a while to accidentally show Israel as what it is: a small country surrounded by enemies, trying to hold onto peace, and fighting like hell when it has to."

    "selftext": "Another slasher movie from Samara which had a setting of 'A Quiet place' embellished with lot of biblical allusion and blood path. Totally set in a mysterious world, movie deals with a quest for survival, hope and revenge. Background score had an important role in illustrating a mystery and elevating it throughout the movie. While maintaining the curiosity, the movies explores many secrets throughout the movie and the mystery they had set makes the movie more impactful. The world can be seen as a different portrayal of hell, if it was on earth even though it reminds me of Quiet place. They did a lot of work in Vfx and it can be seen during the climax, but most of the time it was bad. Samara's performance was good as always, you like it if you like her. You like it if you are a follower of slasher movies and samara weaving and if you want to watch a slasher movie, you will enjoy it.\n\nFollow me on Letterboxd : [https://boxd.it/67lJb](https://boxd.it/67lJb)",

    "selftext": "Both The Lego Movie and Barbie have proven that great films can come from the most unexpected places. So, as much as the trailers tried to convince me otherwise, I walked into A Minecraft Movie with an open mind, hoping it might turn out to be something decent.\n\nReleased just a week after the premiere of Apple TV+’s The Studio—a satire that hilariously skewers the kind of content studios churn out—Minecraft arrived already branded as “the Kool-Aid movie” (a joke from The Studio’s first episode about the absurdity of IP-based filmmaking). Critics quickly pounced, framing it as a symbol of everything wrong with these adaptations. And yes, it is all that: an extremely shallow, easy cash grab. But it’s not the cinematic apocalypse.\n\nIn terms of quality and structure, it reminded me a lot of 2023’s Super Mario Bros. Movie. Like Mario, it’s built around pleasing fans—nostalgia over narrative, cameos over character arcs. I’ve never actually played Minecraft, but even I could tell it was winking at the audience every time a pig wore a crown or a crafting joke popped up and the camera paused for two seconds. The plot exists mostly to move the characters from one set piece to another, with just enough connective tissue to keep things from completely falling apart.\n\nRead my full review at https://reviewsonreels.ca/2025/04/04/a-minecraft-movie/",

    "selftext": "# Inroduction:\n\nThe [Minecraft Movie ](https://btechubabu.com/minecraft-movie-review/#google_vignette)has finally hit theaters, and as a long-time fan of the game, I couldn't wait to dive into this highly anticipated adaptation. Here's my take on the film:\n\n**Plot Overview:** The movie follows Alex, a young adventurer who gets transported into the Minecraft world after discovering a mysterious artifact. With the ability to control the world around them, Alex teams up with iconic characters like Steve to battle a looming threat. It's a fun, family-friendly narrative with themes of teamwork, responsibility, and creativity that Minecraft fans will love.\n\n**Animation and Visuals:** The animation is *stunning*. The film does a great job staying true to Minecraft’s blocky aesthetic while bringing the world to life with smooth 3D animation. From lush forests to the eerie Nether, the film's visuals will surely impress both fans of the game and newcomers.\n\n**Character Development:** While the lead character Alex is well-developed, the supporting characters (like the mobs) don’t get as much depth. However, the dynamic between Alex and Steve is great—bringing humor and warmth to the film.\n\n**Themes and Messages:** The movie conveys strong messages about creativity, collaboration, and the balance between power and responsibility. It also subtly touches on environmentalism, which is a nice touch.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* Stunning animation\n* Nostalgic appeal for fans\n* Strong voice cast\n* Family-friendly content\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* Simple, predictable plot\n* Underdeveloped supporting characters\n\n**Final Thoughts:** Overall, the *Minecraft Movie* is a fun, visually captivating film. While it may not offer a complex plot, it's still an enjoyable experience, especially for fans of the game. It's a solid step forward in adapting the Minecraft universe for the big screen!\n\nWhat do you all think? Did it live up to your expectations?",

    "title": "\"Death of a Unicorn\" Review",
    "selftext": "Jumping right into this, I was super excited to see “Death of a Unicorn”, but at the same time, I was cautiously optimistic about how it was going to turn out. I was afraid that the trailer gave away too much or that it was going to end up being stupid. I was delightfully wrong on most of what I thought!\n\n“Death of a Unicorn” was both directed (first time for a feature film) and written by Scharfman. He’s mostly just been a producer up till now, other than directing a short film. So, kudos to him for an outstanding job out of the gate. Also, nothing but accolades to the casting as well. This was a phenomenal cast that worked well together and played off each other as if they have been doing it for years.\n\nI have always been a fan of the horror/comedy genre (like Ghostbusters and Beetlejuice), so maybe that’s why this was right up my alley. Having Rudd from the Ghostbusters franchise and Ortega from the Beetlejuice franchise just hit the right spot. I think that is a good description of “Death of a Unicorn” too. There were lots of parts where I chuckled out loud a little, and there were parts that were scary and gory, too. So, it had a nice mixture of both.\n\nHonestly, I can’t believe how much I enjoyed this movie. Other than the cast, it had everything working against it to be a flop of a flick, but somehow, it was endearing, funny, had an interesting story, and lots of drama. It hit all the right notes without taking itself too seriously and built a world that I think could be easily added to in a future release. I could even see spin-offs or side movies coming from this, as well.\n\nOverall, this was a great way to spend a couple of hours on a rainy day. I went into the theater with cautious expectations and left in a very good mood after witnessing a surprise movie on the big screen. Was it perfect? …no, but damn was it fun and entertaining. I very happily give this an 8 out of 10!\n\nPlease see the full review here:  \n[https://1guysmindlessmoviereviews.com/2025/04/03/death-of-a-unicorn/](https://1guysmindlessmoviereviews.com/2025/04/03/death-of-a-unicorn/)",

Everyone, kids, teens and parents all seemed to be having a good time and laughing. Kids were explaining to their parents what certain things were. I feel the bar was set when the trailers came out, and for me the movie surpassed it. If you go into it with a \"serious\"/closed mindset or expect by the book Minecraft, you will be disappointed. However if you have an open mind and expect a somewhat \"unserious\" adaptation of the game, you will probably enjoy it. I feel that being creative, adventurous and trying new things or ways is another \"point\" of Minecraft. I feel the cherry on top was after the movie was over and the lights turned on, you could hear kids telling their parents that they couldn't wait to get home to play Minecraft and try some of the stuff they saw. I feel that made the experience better. I would definitely watch it again, my score is 9/10 maybe 9.5/10\nIt's kind of crazy though that it has a 43% critics review on rotten tomatoes, but 87% audience review, as of the writing of this comment.",

    "selftext": "Releasing in theaters tomorrow!\n\nFull review at: https://reviewsonreels.ca/2025/03/31/a-nice-indian-boy/\n\nSeen as a reflection of his own journey of acceptance and the nuances of navigating cultural expectations, director Roshan Sethi (7 Days) was eager to helm A Nice Indian Boy, an adaptation of Madhuri Shekar’s stage play. He cast his partner Karan Soni (best known for the Deadpool trilogy) in the lead role of Naveen Gavaskar—a doctor (like Sethi himself) who grew up suppressing his sexuality. The film focuses on a man who, even after coming out to his family, still carries the weight of having long denied his desires and continues to live in a way that minimizes his presence.\n\nHe meets Jay (Jonathan Groff), a white man adopted by an Indian family who, after years of rejection, is now looking for true love. But falling for someone like Jay forces Naveen to reexamine the quiet, invisible life he’s built. From there, the film follows familiar rom-com beats, but spices them with Indian family traditions being gently (and sometimes awkwardly) challenged. Much like in Ms. Marvel, where Kamala’s parents had to accept her newfound powers, Naveen’s parents are as understanding as they can be—yet once he introduces his white boyfriend, you get the feeling they might have preferred he was secretly a superhero instead.\n\nExamining the cultural clash of traditional Indians living in America provides just the right blend of sweetness and tension to create engaging, often funny situations. The characters are well established and charismatic, and the central conflicts feel mostly genuine—save for one scene where Naveen’s sister comes on a little too strong. That said, the second half can feel a bit dramatically repetitive, as each character goes through a similar arc of accepting one another after a single heartfelt conversation (first Jay, then the sister, then the mom, and so on). While the beats are familiar, they’re still moving thanks to Sethi’s own lived experience guiding the emotional truth of those moments.",

    "selftext": "[Freaky Tales (2025) Movie Review](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/freaky-tales-2025/)\n\nFew directors have had a stranger, more unpredictable decade than [Anna Boden](https://cinephilecorner.com/cast-and-crew/anna-boden/) and [Ryan Fleck](https://cinephilecorner.com/cast-and-crew/ryan-fleck/). After the indie success of *Mississippi Grind* (2015), they found themselves in the [Marvel](https://cinephilecorner.com/lists/marvel-mcu-movies-ranked/) machine directing *Captain Marvel* (2019), a film that was both a massive box office hit and a critical mixed bag. Their latest, *Freaky Tales* (2025), continues their unusual trajectory—an ambitious, nostalgia-driven anthology set in 1980s Oakland that leans heavily on style but struggles to find a cohesive pulse.\n\nSet against a gritty, neon-lit version of Oakland, *Freaky Tales* revolves around four violent, loosely interconnected stories, where an eerie emerald glow drifts through the city, binding the lives of its characters. The aesthetic is certainly compelling, with a carefully curated soundtrack and an attention to period detail that captures a version of the past now long gone. But while the film is rich in atmosphere, its anthology structure proves uneven, making it difficult to stay invested in every segment.\n\nIt’s clear *Freaky Tales* takes inspiration from *Pulp Fiction* and *Slacker*, aiming for that chaotic, time-bending, character-colliding energy. But where those films thrived on sharp, idiosyncratic dialogue and cultural resonance, *Freaky Tales* struggles to justify its fragmented storytelling. The star-studded ensemble—[Pedro Pascal](https://cinephilecorner.com/cast-and-crew/pedro-pascal/), [Tom Hanks](https://cinephilecorner.com/cast-and-crew/tom-hanks/), [Ben Mendelsohn](https://cinephilecorner.com/cast-and-crew/ben-mendelsohn/), [Jay Ellis](https://cinephilecorner.com/cast-and-crew/jay-ellis/), [Dominique Thorne](https://cinephilecorner.com/cast-and-crew/dominique-thorne/)—is impressive on paper but rarely feels like a natural part of the world the film constructs. Even with its notable historical nods, including Jay Ellis’s portrayal of Sleepy Floyd in a reimagined version of his legendary 29-point playoff quarter against the Lakers, the characters feel detached, existing more as isolated vignettes than as pieces of a greater whole.\n\n[Read More Movie Reviews from Cinephile Corner](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/)",

      "It certainly held my attention.  I had a morbid curiosity throughout.  The setup did not lend notice to the fact that it would contain the level of violence it did.  The Act 1,2 ,3 approach let the viewer know this was all going somewhere without spoiling it at all.  Very unpredictable the twists and turns this film takes which is a RARE thing these days.  I highly recommend watching it.  It was refreshing.  Another RARE thing these days.  Too many movies are predictable and just nothing but tropes.  Not this one.  Grab you popcorn.  Suspend reality for a while and just enjoy it for what it is.  It isn't too deep, but it certainly has surface level surprises.  And for sure filled with instant Karma in the end.  Very gratifying."

    "selftext": "I loved this one! In theaters this Friday! Once you’ve seen it, comment what you think!\n\nFreaky Tales is a hyper-stylized anthology film set in 1987 Oakland, California, delivering four interconnected stories that feel like Sin City — but in color, and soaked in Bay Area attitude. The segments range from punk teenagers going head-to-head with neo-Nazis, to an aspiring female rap duo entering a lyrical showdown with a hip-hop legend, to a bounty hunter whose final job goes sideways, and finally, to an NBA star whose world collapses after his family is murdered.\n\nAnthology films often suffer from uneven pacing or wildly varying quality between segments. And while it’s hard to finish Freaky Tales without ranking the stories — for me, each one felt better than the last — what directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck (Captain Marvel, Half Nelson) accomplish here is rare: despite distinct characters, tones, and even visual languages, all four stories genuinely feel that they build one singular movie.\n\nTheir interconnectedness is cleverly constructed. Even if there’s not much thematic consistency (the underdog motif in the first two chapters gives way to darker, more tragic material in the latter ones), the narrative weaving is satisfying. One arc quietly drops details that reframe something seen earlier, and by the fourth chapter, the film brings enough threads together to feel like a complete movie rather than just a series of vignettes.\n\nRead my full review at: https://reviewsonreels.ca/2025/04/01/freaky-tales/",

    "selftext": "Song Hye-Kyo absolutely shines as a tough-as-nails, no-nonsense exorcist nun who will stop at nothing to save a boy from demonic possession.\n\nSong Hye-Kyo is absolutely fantastic as Sister Junia, a nun trained in exorcism but forbidden to practice by the male-dominated patriarchal Church. Sister Junia stands before a conference table full of men who find no greater join than in pointing out to her that she's not an ordained priest and cannot perform exorcisms.\n\nSister Junia, however, takes matters into her own hands and attempts again and again at performing the exorcism. Time is running out. As the possession continues, the demon grows stronger and soon nothing will be able to stop it. The demon reveals that he was involved in the death of martyrs in the middle ages and he returns again and again to kill their descendants. He and his demons plan on possessing and killing thousands of children.\n\nI think one of the movie's weaknesses is a lack of challenges for Sister Junia. Even the misogynistic bishops give way and allow the exorcism. \n\nAnother area horror fans may find lacking is the absence of gore. You won't find any projectile vomit, gruesome murders, or bodies contorting in uncomfortably impossible positions in this movie. Hee-Joon arches his back a lot, his face gets all veiny, and he could probably use a trip to the dentist, but that's the extent of the demonic possession effects. \n\n**Dark Nuns** is a fantastic movie. It was exciting and suspenseful. Song Hye-Kyo is perfect in this role. While it is technically a sequel to 2015's **The Priests**, you don't have to see the first movie to enjoy it. I am, however, looking forward to another installment.

    "selftext": "https://youtube.com/shorts/hLzK8oEKMtg?si=7HZmVri5ESIQMTq2\n\nA Working Man - 6.5/10. One of 2024’s biggest surprise hits (commercially and critically) was “The Beekeeper.” So, it was pretty obvious and inevitable that David Ayer and Jason Statham would team up again. And they teamed up in quick fashion for this film. And it shows, because even though there’s some of the good you found in Beekeeper, unfortunately, this feels like a rushed project. Don’t get me wrong though, the action is still fun and Statham is at his Stathamist best. I guess he’s at the point in his career where he’s just decided to play adrenaline based action first, talk later characters. The man plays another force of nature character, one whose again trying to shake off the past life, but is thrown into the throughs of things due to sentimental reasons. Whose he targeting now you ask? Human traffickers. I can’t lie when I got happy seeing Statham demolish and go full on unconscious rage as he tries to save this young woman’s life (especially when he just kills the traffickers with no remorse or sympathy). The problem here is that, unlike Beekeeper, there’s no real singular effective villain (its a network), nor are the visuals or editing up to par. Speaking of the villain(s), they are comically caricatured and cartoonish here. I get it they’re supposed to cliches, but even cliches need some different spins too! It truly feels like they rushed this project to release very soon, because the editing feels a little rushed, and the visuals feel frenetic in a not so great way. What Ayer and Statham did well in their previous collab was creating the world that the one man wrecking crew would go through, while also giving the character some obstacles and a tougher path to get to where he needs to go. Here, I felt that Statham’s character is having an easy go at things. Not once during a fight do you see the man get nicked by a shot or cut from a knife. He’s dirtied and roughed up, but he doesn’t show any signs of hardship or trouble during his mission. Even in Arnold or Sly films (was surprised to learn Sly helped write the story here), you can see those titans getting some wounds along the way for the most part. As an action lover, the action was fun, but a step down from Beekeeper. Did it pass the time? Yep. But I felt that had they taken a little bit more time, they could’ve made a nice continuation of a surprise hit. Decent, but will be more for Statham fans!",

    "selftext": "*The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie* is a love letter to everyone who grew up watching Looney Tunes cartoons as a kid.  This film, the first fully-animated film starring Looney Tunes characters to ever play in theaters, is a stand-alone adventure featuring Daffy Duck and Porky Pig.  Although the movie will certainly invoke feelings of nostalgia for those already familiar with these characters, the movie’s self-contained story makes it enjoyable for fans as well as those experiencing Daffy or Porky for the first time.\n\nFrom an artistic standpoint, director Peter Browngardt was inspired by the animated shorts made by Bob Clampett for Warner Brothers in the Thirties and Forties.  Although Porky and Daffy look the same, they’re rendered in style that predates the cartoons featured on the Saturday morning TV shows in the Seventies.  The emphasis is less on making the characters cute and cuddly and more on their expressiveness.  One area of consistency is the action, which is always high-energy and frequently explosive.\n\nThe main challenge with a project like this is taking characters who worked extraordinarily well in seven-to-nine minute shorts and building a ninety minute story around them.  Although the plot does have an episodic feel, the overall story works because Porky and Daffy have  character arcs.  Porky learns to trust Daffy despite his ability to mess things up, while Daffy realizes that there is a time and a place for his chaos.  The newcomers–Petunia Pig, Farmer Jim, the Scientist and The Invader–all have their moments.  In regards to The Invader, the filmmakers get kudos for supplying The Invader with the silliest reason ever for an alien race to take over the Earth.\n\n*The Day the Earth Blew Up* is funny, visually inventive and, unlike Warner Brothers Discovery, honors the legacy of the Looney Tunes cartoons.  The movie is a testament to what hand-drawn animation can achieve when in the right hands.  Although 2025 is only three months old, this movie is already the front-runner for comedy of the year.  **Highly Recommended**.\n\n[https://detroitcineaste.net/2025/04/01/the-day-the-earth-blew-up-a-looney-tunes-movie/](https://detroitcineaste.net/2025/04/01/the-day-the-earth-blew-up-a-looney-tunes-movie/)",

    "selftext": "https://youtube.com/shorts/n2kexDYVTJY?si=97mcKDFq-7oiMvto\n\nAghathiyaa - 3/10. Pa Vijay seems really keen on making these period piece films. His first major starring role came in the movie “Ilaignan” (which was a period piece about the building of a grand ship). Like that film, his first directed film where he doesn’t star in also happens to be a period piece which is full of interesting and well made sets with attention to costume designs. But, like Ilaignan, this picture is hampered by being old fashioned and just really a relic of its time. When I first heard about this film, I only saw the poster, and thought: this was going to be an Indiana Jones type of picture. Well, I got that hilariously wrong. This is yet another horror dramedy, but there’s nothing scary, nothing dramatic, and nothing funny here. Again, the attention to the sets, costumes, and visuals are commendable. Pa Vijay has tried to bring some difference in terms of the supernatural implications here. But it all muddles down to a movie that feels like a two in one. The portions with Arjun feel like a different movie altogether, and Jiiva’s feels like another movie that Vijay just wanted to mash the story with here. Again, I commend the attempt at trying something different here, but Aghathiyaa just feels bland and tired.",

    "title": "Chintu ka Birthday - A Celebration of Hope Among Chaos",
    "selftext": "THIS REVIEW DOES NOT CONTAIN SPOILERS \n\nName : Chintu ka Birthday \nRelease Year : 2019\nDirector : Satyanshu Singh \nCinematographer: Siddharth Diwan\n\nChintu ka Birthday is produced by comedians Tanmay Bhat, Rohan Joshi, Ashish Shakya and Gursimran Khamba of AIB under their banner First Draft. It is a generous and uplifting film about an Indian family stranded in a war-torn Iraq amidst the fall of Saddam Hussein. The family, determined to celebrate the birthday of their son, Chintu, faces various hindrances, from bombing to detention, but their will remains resilient despite the dire circumstances.\nThe film subtly highlights the plight of Iraqis by showing the struggles of families stuck in this turmoil and chaos. It further touches on India's incomplete extraction of all Indians from Iran. Despite the downhill scenario, Chintu's family is determined to make the celebration a success.\n\nVedant Chibber, who played the role of Chintu had done a great job of capturing the innocence and naivety of a child. Bisha Chaturvedi, who took the role of Lakshmi, Chintu's sister, portrayed the character as a loving sister and a person who is not afraid to take a stand when needed. Tillotoma Shome and Vinay Pathak, were indeed dexterous in expressing the warmth and optimism of Chintu's parents amidst their gloomy relaity. Seema Pahwa, who is the Nani of Chintu also did justice to her role as an aged woman who is now frustrated in the foreign land and years to go to her home\n\nThe movie should be watched with an open heart rather than a critical mindset of judging every fact. Certain characters have been shown to be overly generous and idealist but that can be overlooked for a feel good vibe of the film.",

    "title": "Snow White (2025) was actually (mostly) good",
    "selftext": "An official theater kid review :)\n\nCostumes:\nThey weren’t terrible, but they also could’ve been much better. I honestly didn’t really put much thought into them while I was watching. They were a little forgettable. I definitely wasn’t a fan of Zegler’s hair, as it didn’t suit her in the slightest. Unfortunately for her, I can imagine the backlash they would’ve gotten over changing the style.\n\nCGI:\nThe CGI of the animals was extremely well done. They managed to preserve a lot of the art style from the original film, while also adding a more realistic look. I got a slight uncanny feeling from the dwarves, but only when I looked them up post-watch. They didn’t bother me at all when I actually saw the movie. I think they were stylized just enough that they weren’t too realistic. A full cartoon look would’ve been extremely out of place compared to everything else in the movie.\n\nSets: \nEverything about the sets was amazing. The props, details, and the lighting were all perfectly placed in each scene. The castle interiors were especially impressive.\n\nMusic:\nThis is where I think a lot of people lost interest in the movie. The point of musicals is that the songs are essential to the plot- they move the story along. If you skip them, you’re missing some pretty essential themes. The songs are the plot. If you’re not a musical lover, this movie isn’t for you, and it won’t make as much sense. My favorite line from this movie is actually in one of the last songs. “…you’re everything you were wishing and waiting for,” which summarizes the entire theme of the movie: princes are nice to have, but it’s important to be able to do things on your own. The music itself was amazing, which is unsurprising given the writers are Pasek and Paul. You can definitely hear some Dear Evan Hansen in “A Hand Meets a Hand.” \n\nPerformance:\nRachel Zegler was amazing in this movie, and I won’t ever change my opinion on that. Her voice was the only one I couldn’t immediately hear pitch correction or auto tune for. If you’re going to cast a musical movie, this is the kind of performance you need, and she exceeded every expectation. Her acting was the perfect mix of theatrical and traditional. Burnap was great in his role as well. I loved how he portrayed the character as charming, but actually gave him a personality. He wasn’t static like in the original film. His vocal performance matched Zegler’s extremely well, although I think she overpowered him in some areas. As much as I hate to say it, I didn’t love Gal Gadot in this movie. Her acting was okay, and she fit the role appearance-wise. However, her vocal performance was extremely underwhelming. Don’t get me wrong, she could definitely hit the belting notes at the end of her song, but the autotune was off the charts 90% of the time. I would’ve enjoyed “All is Fair,” much more if she weren’t performing it. It wasn’t a poorly written song, it just needed an actress with stronger vocals and better technique. \n\nChemistry:\nI’ll be honest, I don’t understand the complaints on the chemistry between Jonathan and Snow. Was it the best I’ve ever seen? No. But to be fair, there was no chemistry at all in the original. I’d call that a definite improvement, and one I really enjoyed. It doesn’t have to be slow-burn to be good.\n\nThe Changes:\nI will say that they changed a lot in order to drive the story in its intended direction. The origin for Snow White’s name was the first one I noticed, but I liked how they explained it using weather rather than her appearance. This change made more sense plot-wise in this version. Even with the alterations, the original story was still very clearly there. They made Snow White more independent, but it’s not like she started the movie as such. She grew as the story progressed. Just like Jonathan, her character was made into a more dynamic version of the source material. The ending was completely different, but the outcome was pretty much the same. I actually thought this version’s ending was much more gratifying, as Snow White got to confront the Queen on her own.\n\nSummary:\nAll in all, I really enjoyed this movie, and I’ve listened to the soundtrack many times since. If I were to watch it again, there are definitely scenes I would skip, but it wasn’t as terrible as the internet made it out to be. But I will say, if you’re expecting a scene-for-scene remake, you will most likely be disappointed. It’s an adaptation of the original, and should be viewed as such. \n\n",

      "I agree with your review to a T. \n\nI'm a fan of Gal Gadot, but I do agree that she fit appearance-wise but not really vocally or acting-wise. She didn't have the oomph that say Charlize Theron had in *Snow White and the Huntsman* or Angelina Jolie in *Maleficent*. One of the very few times I felt frightened of her character was when she turned into an old lady and started popping and cracking lol. I only see her as Wonder Woman and Giselle.  \n\nAs for Zegler’s hair, it kind of grew on me but throughout the movie it was a bit inconsistent in style. Like in some scenes it was shorter but wavy, then in some it looked longer and \"bobby\" .. Idk. \n\nLastly, some of the things in the movie kind of reminded me of Tangled (e.g. that Jonathan was a thief, the fireflies reminded me of the lantern scene) which I find a bit worrisome... because what if they do a live-action Tangled in the future?"

    "selftext": "One flew over the cuckoo's nest is a classic comedy movie directed by Miloš Forman staring Jack Nicholson which deals with the story of Mc Murphy, who put in a mental asyulum. No wonder this movie is considered as a classic even though the movie deals with comedy genre. There are many things beyond the performance of Jack Nicholson as Mc Murphy. The 'one' referred in the title of the movie who flew over cuckoo's nest is Mc Murphy himself. One can find himself as a representation of the people who break the barriers of the society and think differently if you can consider the mental asyulum as a society. In a particular situation Mac says to his fellow patients, who are his friends actually, that they are no crazier than the average asshole around on the street. When one consider the mental asyulum as a society, one can find the patients here as the citizens who are being silenced by the system's rule and regulation. Medication which given to them can be seen as the implementation of the ideology and it makes them silence. Shock treatments in this movie represents how the people are forced or tortured by the system if they try to break the barrier. One can definitely find this movie as a rebellion against the society and system which here referred as a mental asyulum. Human society itself is a mental asyulum and it is the rules, regulations, cultural and ideologies which creates a human harmony and cooperation. One who tries to break this system are brutally suppressed. Some find this movie as tragic, however for me the climax is wholesome because it generates hope in the mind of people who watch this and it also explores the sacrifices they need to make in order to find hope and to break the boundaries and think differently.\n\nFollow me on Letterboxd : [https://boxd.it/67lJb](https://boxd.it/67lJb)",

      "Come See Me in the Good Light - so my first impression was I loved the film. I want to still love this film but a hero has fallen for me.\n\nIt was engaging and had some of Andreas poems & performances and really funny sense of humor. I’ve been a fan of Andrea Gibson for a decade and was excited for the film. Visually stunning film and very well paced. I was disappointed in the films direction of the main topic being a love story between Andrea and their wife Meg. Few red flags about the relationship: Meg is a poet who edits Andreas poems to the point of Andrea being in tears. They talk about how Meg just has this “superior English knowledge” to Andreas. Meg is significantly younger than Andrea with a lot less success professionally. The tiny glimpse the audience shows of Megs poetry shows that the talent and craft is not on par. Which is understandable bc Andrea has had a successful career as a spoken word poet. Meg is younger and in my opinion is not anywhere near Andreas talent. At one point Meg poem about Andreas stomach being distended from terminal illness and how it looks like her little bit chubby belly. It all felt like such a self centered the attitude towards Andreas cancer. Like your fat tummy is more important than ovarian cancer? Who cares and it wasn’t particularly insightful or interesting or well written. But then another part did seem strange, so this is kind of the peak of the movie is that one of Andreas cancer markers for ovarian cancer, specifically ca-125, is fluctuating. It’s a big part of the drama of the film. Testing every three weeks. Years and laughter, very moving.  Through the film ca-125 is Between the 10-20 range, well I looked up that marker and the range.. and it’s within a normal range for a healthy person?! It’s a bit confusing and I would love some clarity from a doctor who has seen the film. Andrea at one point mentions a therapist saying Andrea has hypochondria and I don’t think it’s irrelevant. The timeline of the movie makes it seem like andrea was medically supposed to have died years ago. I question the reliability of Andrea as a narrator for this medical journey. I got the impression there are some exaggerated truths here. Andrea also is like in and out of a wheel chair but also lifting weights and looks in excellent health other than being very thin. Which they’ve always been thin. I also think that hypochondria makes a lot of sense, Andrea seems to struggle with mental health in a severe way (like many) and this seems to be a manifestation of that. I didn’t really see Andrea critically till this film but watching it definitely opened my eyes to what I felt was very attention seeking behavior and a toxic relationship.\n\nCurious what others impression of the film was.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ir0w8i7qhxse1.jpeg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=27be0c195d5ca6114623fab6ddfbacb9d17eb5f0"

    "title": "“The Woman in The Yard” Loiters Even its 85 Minute Runtime – Review",
    "selftext": "“The Woman in the Yard” is Jaume Collet-Serra’s follow-up to December Netflix hit “Carry On.” This time, he ventures into horror with a small budget of $12 million (compared to “Carry On’s” $47 million). There are some good ideas here and interesting moments but much of the film’s best parts seem to borrow from other, better films of the genre. This film feels like an extended student project, which seems to describe the bulk of Blumhouse originals.\n\nAfter a fatal car accident that killed her husband, David (Russell Hornsby), Ramona (Danielle Deadwyler) is left with a broken leg and is now a single mother to her two kids, Taylor (Peyton Jackson) and Annie (Estella Kahiha). They live in a fixer-upper house on a farm with sparse neighbors and electricity problems for the day. With no power and no one to ask for help, they are left to deal alone with a strange Woman in the Yard (Okwui Okpokwasili) clad in black cloth from head to toe, mysteriously warning them, “today’s the day.” As the family’s grip on reality loosens and the strange woman becomes a threat to their safety, Ramona is forced to confront her darkest sides to protect her kids and herself.\n\nThe cast is extremely small and most of the film takes place in and around this farmhouse except for a few flashback scenes. Deadwyler delivered a convincing performance but her ability to shine was held back by the lack of character nuance. Her character is angry for 95% of this film which makes this solely labeled “horror” film feel like more of an aimless domestic drama. Jackson turned in a serviceable performance though it is clear he lacks experience. He’s also confined in character to be a moody, coming-of-age teen who hates his mom. Taylor and Ramona spend a fair bit of time shouting at each other, which makes much of this film exhausting to watch. Kahiha was very good for as young as she is. With her smartly limited screen time, she does all she needs to for her part and helps to contrast the emotional cast with a quieter and shyer character. She essentially is the final emotional punching bag in the family rotation and has nowhere to direct her anger (if she had any).\n\nAs a low-budget movie, it doesn’t always look like it. The visuals are usually beautiful and cinematographer Pawel Pogorzelski finds interesting ways to shoot in a somewhat limited space. Perhaps some more of the budget should have been spent on developing the script as the first 45 minutes or so feel like a chore to sit through. The film grinds the same emotional rhythm for far too long, which essentially tells us that the family is dysfunctional over and over again. Collet-Serra could’ve found a way to condense scenes or remove redundant beats but it doesn’t seem like efficiency was at the forefront of his priorities. Instead, it feels like he’s trying to stretch the runtime of what could’ve been a really effective 20 or 30 minute short film. Especially with the lack of thematic depth, a feature-length runtime isn’t really supported by this student-film quality of script.\n\nI believe this film’s ending is meant to be ambiguous, which could've hit harder for me if we were given more evidence for both sides of the outcome. In the first half, there wasn't much to discover or think about. In the second half, it seems like we get too much too fast or maybe I was still waking up. I couldn’t keep straight what the rules were and who was truly who by the end of the film because like in a scene of light-strobing, information and events ramp up and it’s hard to tell what’s going on. I think if I watched this film for a second time, I would learn a little bit more but not enough to justify the rewatch.\n\nThe film plays with the five stages of grief, The (Denial) Woman (Anger) in (Bargaining) the (Depression) Yard (Acceptance), but everything is accessed on the surface level which leaves little impact and resonance after the ending. Throughout is a sparsely included theme of mirrors, except for the ending, when it delivers heavy-handed metaphors. If you watch an explainer video after this film, I think you’ll be disappointed if you’re looking for something deeper than what the film actually offers. There are some cool nuggets of impact of lines being recontextualized and seeing events differently, but ultimately, the whole thing is a little disappointing.\n\nThe movie feels slightly vague and afraid of specifics overall. Despite being labeled a “horror” film, only in the last third or fourth of the film do things start to become more unhinged psychologically that dip into the realm of supernatural. This is where the rules of the world start to become confusing and at that point, I’m just grateful the film is only 85 minutes long.\n\n  \n2/5 stars",

    "selftext": "https://youtube.com/shorts/srnB8oa4al0?si=lzlJBJVceR-zaEmn\n\nBorderline - 6/10. Not really a spoiler but that credit scene is pretty similar to the iconic “Pearl” credit sequence. Borderline starts off really strong and really intriguing. We’ve seen films of this nature before in terms of a character having grand disillusions of their lives and ending up acting upon those disillusions. Think “The King Of Comedy” mixed with “Misery” a bit with a dash of the tamil movie “Guna.” Here, we have a character who believes that he is destined to marry a famous pop star, and goes to great (and disturbing) lengths to achieve this goal. The rest of the story is whether or not he achieves this goal. The thing about Borderline is that you have good performances from both honorary Scream Queen Samara Weaving and Ray Nicholson, an interesting setup, and the overall execution is solid till we get to the second half. And then, things slowly (but surely) comes to a crashing chaotic mess. That’s the big issue here, and its sad to see. I feel like had they made a stronger ending, this would’ve been such a solid genre film. But once we ultimately get to the climatic wedding scene, we feel like the movie’s sputtering on fumes by then. The humour is not laugh out loud funny, more so it relies on the ridiculousness of the situations. The horror element is not really that crazy here either. Its not boring at all as well, as I really felt the time fly by. But, to be honest, this is a film that needed more fine tuning towards its story and direction in the second half. Just okay!",

Having been in theatres for less than 2 months, it is already the 5th highest-grossing film of all time to date, surpassing the likes of Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Avengers: Infinity War.\n\n2019’s Ne Zha is a spectacular debut feature by director Jiaozi that manages to have its cake and eat it, balancing spectacle and story, action and drama, adrenaline and tears. While taking creative liberties with its source material, Jiaozi crafts a story that emphasises the core spirit of the titular character without sacrificing the intricate world-building and character dynamics that have captivated readers and audiences for centuries. Half a decade later, he is back with a sequel that takes both the story and spectacle to another level, weaving in plot complexities that unveil the greyness of morality and the duality of good and evil even further.\n\nIt's safe to say that Ne Zha 2 was the most intense and mind-pulverising experience I have ever had in a cinema.\n\nCheck out my full [review](https://andreusjh99.github.io/film/review/2025/03/20/review-nezha2.html) of the film and let me know what you think and whether you agree!",

    "selftext": "Death of a Unicorn frustrated me to no end. It’s the latest in a growing list of 2025 films with a cool premise and utterly lifeless execution—this year is full of them! From Love Hurts to Companion to A24’s own Opus, we’re seeing a trend of underbaked ideas masquerading as bold cinema. This is one of those movies where the lack of effort becomes the defining trait. The script, the performances, the direction—everything feels like a rough draft of a better idea someone else already made. And while it might pass as disposable entertainment for some, it’s arguably more harmful to the future of cinema than the ultra-expensive MCU entries or Netflix algorithm dumps. Because if this is what convinces someone to buy a ticket, only to walk out having felt nothing, thought nothing, and barely enjoyed themselves—why would they return?\n\nThe setup plays like a standard “eat the rich” satire: a father and daughter—Elliot (Paul Rudd) and Ridley (Jenna Ortega)—hit a unicorn while driving to Elliot’s boss’s remote estate. Turns out, the unicorn’s blood and horn have healing powers, and soon the ultra-wealthy family sees a chance to profit. Meanwhile, Ridley is the only one who grasps the obvious: maybe we should leave the unicorns alone—especially when more of them start showing up, drawn by the injured one.\n\nFull review at https://reviewsonreels.ca/2025/03/28/death-of-a-unicorn/\n\nMy Favorite Scene: The rich trying to describe the unicorn.",

That childhood flashback portion was documented well. It brilliantly captures the essence of the movie such as the friendship between Amir and Hassan, religion and political situations during that time. How these situations creates a gap between those two are also portrayed well. Performance wise each and every artists did a great job especially those child artists and the person who plays the role of the father character of Amir. They affectively captures the major themes of the book such as the friendship, religion and politics and how true human relationship crosses all the barriers set by politics and religion which is set by and artificially created human. Human relationship is transparent and universal. It is genuine and natural and it is also boundless. It grosses all boundaries created by the human kind. Those aspects cannot influence love and friendship because it is beyond everything. Movie also discusses fate's involvement in character change and the consequences of karma. Not great but not a bad one.\n\nFollow me on Letterboxd : [https://boxd.it/67lJb](https://boxd.it/67lJb)",

    "title": "Movie Review - Holland",
    "selftext": "https://youtube.com/shorts/1x75vBvCq2Q?si=_2MQJ8-DBCZildeY\n\nHolland - 5.5/10. Oh so disappointed by this one! Mimi Cave made her debut with the romantic horror film “Fresh,” which was an interesting cannibal film. Here, she switches gears to a more mystery thriller route, which is mixed in with drama and featuring a great performance from Nicole Kidman. Nicole Kidman is awesome here, and she seems to have perfected this type of role in this type of film. Ironically, she’s done back to back films where she’s cheating on her spouse. Here though, she is suspecting that things are not alright with her husband. Its a suburban drama that is being buoyed by Kidman at her A game, but it just never makes itself interesting for the most part. We get a last quarter which feels a little interesting, but the twist and reveal of the husband’s secret life just feels so predictable and redundant of other films. For a mystery, it just never gets going in terms of creating an atmosphere and intrigue as to what will happen next. Its sad really, as I was really anticipating this film for quite sometime. Sadly, a misfire which is saved by a good Kidman performance!",

    "title": "Holland (2025)- New Prime movie w/ Nicole Kidman",
    "selftext": "It’s been three months since we saw Nicole Kidman starring in a film with Babygirl. You know what that means, right? Time for one of the most active actresses working today to grace the screen again — beyond the AMC commercial about cinema magic. She’s taken on so many characters over the years (and she always commits, taking each project seriously), but I can’t help playing a quick game of matching past performances to new ones.\n\nOnce again, Kidman plays an unfulfilled wife (Babygirl), who senses something is off (The Stepford Wives), but this time with her own slightly naughty agenda (To Die For). I like all these performances and elements individually, and mixing them with a kind of Jeanne Dielman-style life frustration makes for a great premise. But Holland never manages to bring it all together. The result is a protagonist who’s hard to root for — in a thriller where we should absolutely be on her side. It makes the whole “discovering what’s going on” stretch feel painfully slow, and by the time characters finally piece things together (in a twist that isn’t all that surprising), it’s too late — and the film doesn’t commit to doing much with it anyway.\n\nThere are small glimmers of a good thriller buried in there. Holland, Michigan is a great setting — there’s always something compelling about a mystery unfolding in a seemingly perfect small town. The lone-wife dynamic has promise too, and the central mystery is a solid foundation. Alex Somers’ score helps a lot — eerie, memorable, and setting a mood the film struggles to match elsewhere. I also really liked the use of miniatures.\n\nBut Mimi Cave’s direction ends up squandering most of the good ideas and wasting a great cast. It’s especially disappointing because Fresh was such a tight, effective debut. Here, she seems unsure of what movie she wants to make. And like Olivia Wilde in Don’t Worry Darling, she leans on inconsequential dream sequences that exist mostly for trailer-ready imagery and end up feeling totally irrelevant to the plot.\n\nRead my full review at https://reviewsonreels.ca/2025/03/24/holland/\n",

      "Maybe this whole time, Nancy was one of the killed women, stuck in the fake town and that was her story. She never killed Fred, or had a kid, or even met Dave. She never wanted to leave the town, because she couldn't. Stuck in that fake world Fred created. It kind of explains her strange dream, running through the fake town, screaming for help but there's no one there. Maybe I'm taking it too literal, but that's the only explanation for that shitty ending 😭",
      "What was up with that ending?\nI feel cheated. It had me on the edge of my seat wondering what the reveal would be. And then it just went downhill. I have a lot of questions and I’m not even bothered enough to ask them.",
      "I am biased because I live in Holland, Michigan ..lol. I do have questions though so I'm hoping more people will post their thoughts/ideas.",
      "i thought fred was kevin spacy, what happened to Dave? nancy had the head trauma at the end, was it saying she was crazy and there was no Dave?",
      "A few  things I didn't understand were Fred's latest victim. How did he meet her? She acted like she was expecting him. Did she pay him to murder her and feed her dogs?\n\nAlso, what was the point of the whole missing earring subplot and firing the babysitter?",
      "Did harry know his dad was a killer",
      "I personally wouldn't waste your time watching this movie. Let's be honest here... its SHIT",
      "What a waste of time this movie was",
      "My take away is that Dave left town, like the train leaving the town at the end, Dave left. He said there were days he thought it was the perfect place and some days it was but was it only a dream..or something to that effect. It seems this is Nancy and Dave years later reminiscing on their life there during that time. Nancy stayed, Dave left.",
      "What was the point of having the racist redneck family living in Holland? It didn’t fit the ideal town. Nor did the grunge babysitter. Was the town just a normal town and it was Nancy’s small community that were just in a religious cult? However if the town was a dream of the model town then still - having rednecks is a random addition.  This movie was all over the place",
      "I’m from holland Michigan so I was super excited to watch this film, the ending tho was lame. Super confusing. Like is Dave just an apart of her imagination? Also I’ve heard some of the people in town speak Dutch but never to the extent of how it was in the movie.",
      "I think Dave didn't really exist",
      "Did anyone notice the pearl earring looks like the one in the painting, Girl With a Pearl Earring, by Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer? I was wondering if that was a coincidence, mistake or some clue.",

It flashes red and then to this other random boy wearing THE EARRING for a fraction of a second. This isn't Harry! Who tf is this boy?!",

But then it’s a lame double bluff because she was right her husband was up to no good just not in the way she thought",
      "What do you mean she paid him, she probably just invited him for a dinner/date...",
      "I wondered that too. He look enlightened by that Polaroid but that was it.",
      "Harry didn't know his dad was a killer but he heard his mother's conversation with Dave about his father. Second he saw blood on his mother's forehead which he thought maybe his father hurt her so he had the instinct to run away from the car.",

      "I agree. People are reaching with the 'same person/never existed' when the whole movie shows that the reason they connected in the movie was because they were dealing with the same shit but in different ways.\n\nDave runs away, Nancy shoves it down deep. Both dealing with the same type of problems which the overlapping voices symbolizes imo",
      "Holland is a super diverse town, lots of mixed culture here, not much racism so that was super confusing to me as well.",
      "I took it as the guy was mad that the teacher referred him to child services and was pretending to be a racist to scare him. It seemed like he didn't know how to be a racist the right way and was just saying things that he saw in movies.",
      "That’s a good description",

      "I was watching this movie and was really liking it halfway in, wondering why it got so many bad reviews, which I didn't read to prevent spoilers, just saw star ratings.\n\nI am starting to think that it was a pilot that was turned into a movie after gaining no traction, or a cancelled project. \n\nIt just makes no sense how it ended like that unless the true ending was so bad, maybe it's a case of bad editing and this editor loves open ended nonsense choose your own adventure endings...",
      "OK the voices at the end >!started overlapping; It made me question whether Dave was real or he and Nancy were the same person?!?!!<\n\nThe characters just needed more depth and some more story elements. I went into this blind; didn’t know whether to expect a horror, thriller, art film, drama, whatever.",
      "Maybe she meant her affair with Dave, like maybe she was questioning her/their feelings or something like that...",
      "Not that I'm aware of. Also, I've never heard any Hollanders using Dutch language either. I'm not saying it doesn't happen, I've just never heard it.",
      "Exactly! I'm from the tulip city and I believe that some things are not true either.\n\nHolland is more than just the name of a movie. It is where people learn, perform, aspire, AND *inspire*",
      "He was in her dream too right? What a bad movie what the hell lol",
      "Kid looks like a Hummel",
      "Oh yeah I remember that lol but also...I'm sure that's not even the earring. The earring she was missing was pearl.",
      "Right! That's exactly it",
      "They briefly say he’s terrified of the police because of something in his past and I’m guessing why he split at the end. I’m wondering if Nancy dumped her husband in the lake afterwards, because it shows her back involved in the community. If everyone knew what her husband is she’d be ostracized.",
      "Great take, I think you're right.",
      "You mean the: \"Was it even real?\"\nEven if that sentence has been over-over-used.. I like it here, because nowadays we have so many different levels of \"reality\" (VR, other technologies, you can think of parallel/metaverse, psychological differences in how we perceive etc. etc. etc.) so it made ME think a lot about that. \nFor me that sentence is set in a new context. And it makes sense for me that it's so boldly presented, kind of like a \"happily ever after\" in a fairytale as for me it had a weird fairytale touch (mostly in the way Nicole K. acts, as if she was a child or so...). And fairytales have as many layers as realities have.\nDon't know if my thoughts make sense to anyone. It's just what I got from the movie. I don't want to say it's good or bad..",
      "Yep.. it starts entertaining enough. Gets worse once the twist is revealed and gives up in its 5 last minutes. What were they thinking?",
      "Same. I ignored the low ratings, purposely didn't read the reviews. I enjoyed the film, right up until the last moment.\n\nWas so mad at the end, what a waste of time.\n\nI don't understand how they managed to get such big stars on board, for such an awful film??",
      "Yeah honestly the ending sucked ass like the description was that there was a deeper mystery in the town itself that she would discover but the actual reveal didn't deliver. Like I was expecting more and never got it and felt the movie could have been set anywhere because what was the point of it being in Holland in the first place other the unique background. The ending wraps up immediately and just makes you feel confused that it's over and doesn't provide a satisfying conclusion at all. It was good up until the end and then it did a total nosedive. I watched it for the two leads but man I feel like I wasted two hours as I never got any background information on Nicole and her coworker or on the town itself.",
      "As a Dutch person who has visited Holland... nothing about it is Dutch but the name haha.",
      "What I was expecting was when Harry woke, it should surprise you; I thought we would discover Nancy and maybe Harry were some manifestation of the characters from his ideal miniature town. \n\nI asked my AI and he said it was Nancy joining his darkside by >!killing Dave as part of her bonding back with Fred. “!<"

The beginning of the story deals with a pritviraj's flashback scene which had around thirty minutes and it was so good and so impactful in every case especially technical department cooked really well in a sense that we once think that we are witnessing an international movie and Abimanyu sing's entry was so good and prithvi successfully portrays the aura of Abimanyu's character. The hardwork that made by each and every department can be seen in the movie like I have said we put us in a thought that we are watching an international movie or something. Deepav Dev's score and Mohanlal's screen presence was another positive sides I have found good in this movie, especially the entry of Mohanlal and a fight scene in jungle, it was so good and pure, impactful and punch creating. But I felt some down point about Quershi abraham comparing to Stephen Nedupally. Mohanalal as Stephen Nedupally was so good but as Quershi it was ok feel, but some scenes are so good, especially the entry of Mohanlal, which was one of the best and I would say that Pritvi successfully captures the aura of Mohanalal. I was not satisfied in climax fight scene, climax can be more creative, but the movie made till that more interesting and enjoyable. Length was also a problem, but it causes no effect while considering the overall outlook of the movie.

Although this too discusse politics but in a much large manner and also have a slow paced start, something felt different from lucifer. Also at some point I thought Lucifer was better and vice-versa. The visuals and Making was of  a Hollywood Level. The Kureshi Abraam Role Was Not upto expectations but stephen Was fire as always ( Just Like Leo and Parthipan in Leo) but the Climax Fight of KA with ZM was pure goosebumps.The Music also gave a mixed experience while it elevated most of the Scenes well, But was also Cringe at some point of the movie. Plus Abhimanyu Singh's Villain Role Failed To provide What Vivek Obroi's Bobi Have Delivered in the First part.Hatred is expected, plus new people will come to degrade even more with the politics involved. The Opening Scene and Tail End was Worth Every Penny and had top notch making.Fully Satisfied the L fanboy in me 🙌🏻. Definitely a Theater watch stuff 💯🙌🏻",

But the way they portraid Priyadarshini and Stephen was 🔥. Also I have a feeling like in L3 they need to add another person to do the musics along with D.D. Imo Sana would be a great choice. And I don't think they should entirely remove D.D, since he did delivered some quality stuffs in L2 and was Great in L1 imo. They Just need to focus more on the script instead of trying to make it another Salar or KGF.",

    "title": "Black Bag",
    "selftext": "*Black Bag* has a lot going for it. It’s directed, shot and edited by Steven Soderbergh, who elevates the material to a higher level. As was evident with [*Presence*](https://detroitcineaste.net/2025/02/05/presence-movie-review-and-analysis-steven-soderbergh/), his sleek style can make even the thinnest material worth watching. Soderbergh has much more to work with here than that wan ghost story, and he makes this ordinary espionage thriller as electric as it could ever be. As is typical for a Soderbergh film, every shot is beautifully framed and perfectly lit. As the editor, he keeps the story moving at a brisk place, never allowing a scene to overstay its welcome. The film’s light and jazzy score is from David Holmes, a regular contributor on Soderbergh’s films. If you’ve seen *Ocean’s Eleven* as many times as I have, you’ll immediately recognize the similarities.\n\nThe movie serves as a reunion of sorts for Soderbergh, with Michael Fassbender (*Haywire*) and Cate Blanchett (*The Good German*) as the married MI6 agents at the center of things. Although their performances aren’t particularly noteworthy here, Soderbergh uses their contrasting acting styles to generate sparks between them. Fassbender plays another emotionally repressed leader in the Magneto and Steve Jobs mold, while Blanchett is all steely gazes and crocodile grins. The supporting cast is solid, with each adding their singular quirks and energy to the proceedings.\n\nThe issue I had with *Black Bag* is with its scope. The movie suffers from a lack of ambition. Considering the stakes involved, I kept waiting for the movie to take me outside of London. When it does, it amounts to a brief meeting on a bench in Zurich and a shot of an exploding car on a country road. The film didn’t need to resort to the globe-trotting extremes of the Bond, Mission Impossible or Bourne films, but it feels unnaturally tethered to three principle locations (a home, an office and a lake).\n\nSoderbergh has collaborated with screenwriter David Koepp frequently over the past several years, and I understand why he was drawn to this screenplay. It’s full of snappy spy banter, which is fun to listen to but eventually makes all of the characters sound alike. Aside from Fassbender’s character, nobody has more than one defining personality trait. Blanchett is as captivating as she always is, but I’ll be damned if I can remember anything about her beyond her flowing wardrobe. Pierce Brosnan has a cameo in the movie, which is notable only for a restaurant scene with a live fish entree. Coming in at ninety minutes, the movie feels skimpy and would have benefitted from an additional ten or fifteen minutes of character development and backstory.\n\nWith its limited scope, *Black Bag* looks like a well-made episode of a television series headlined by two A-List actors. Thankfully, Steven Soderberg’s visually arresting direction and charismatic performances from Cate Blanchett and Michael Fassbender ensure this modest tale of skullduggery is always entertaining. **Recommended**.\n\n[https://detroitcineaste.net/2025/03/25/black-bag-movie-review-and-analysis-cate-blanchett-michael-fassbender/](https://detroitcineaste.net/2025/03/25/black-bag-movie-review-and-analysis-cate-blanchett-michael-fassbender/)",

    "title": "Film: Wicked - A Deep Dive into Racially Insensitive Tropes Towards Caucasian/white men.",
    "selftext": "Some films leave a lasting impact on audiences — whether it’s because of stunning visuals, emotional depth, or thought-provoking themes. *Wicked*, however, does none of these things. In fact, it’s the worst film ever made. Sure, it has catchy tunes and a whole lot of green makeup, but when you take a closer look, you’ll find that *Wicked* is a racially insensitive minefield, especially when it comes to its portrayal of Caucasian characters. Yes, I’m serious. Strap in, because we’re about to uncover why *Wicked* not only misses the mark, but does so with an uncomfortable slant that’s downright offensive.\n\n**The Green Witch – An Allegory of Racial Injustice?** First off, we have Elphaba, the so-called \"Wicked Witch.\" She’s green. Get it? She’s different. But this “otherness” is hardly a subtle commentary on racial issues. It’s an overt depiction of how society treats people who don’t fit the conventional beauty standards – and how the *real* problem here is that *she’s green*! Could this be the filmmakers' sly way of saying that anyone with a little more pigment in their skin is automatically evil? Why not make her, I don’t know, purple or blue? Oh wait, that would be too obvious, wouldn’t it? The entire premise centers around a character who is ostracized for her appearance — and not just her physical traits, but *her color*.\n\nBut let’s not forget the real victims here: the poor, pure, innocent Caucasian characters. Glinda, for instance, is practically perfect. She’s blonde, beautiful, and... oh yes, *she’s white.* And she gets everything. The princess, the popularity, the friendship of the people. So when Elphaba gets green and, oh, *a little bit angry,* we see how unfair it is. She's not just the \"other\" in a literal sense — she's the villain. The film’s message: don't mess with the status quo of blonde, white princesses! Elphaba’s problem isn't the discrimination she faces, it’s that she dares to disrupt the \"Caucasian Dream.\"\n\n**The \"Glinda-ification\" of White Innocence** In *Wicked*, the narrative of the beautiful, perfect, and eternally cheerful Glinda is an archetype of whiteness. She embodies everything \"pure\" and \"good\" about the world. Glinda’s character stands as a walking, singing, and laughing symbol of Caucasian perfection, while Elphaba, with all her green skin and righteous rage, represents chaos and rebellion. The film’s overly simplistic portrayal of white innocence versus green rage is almost a coded warning: Don’t mess with the \"pure\" Caucasian ideals of beauty and power.\n\nImagine the implications for a minute: Glinda, the angelic blonde girl, is constantly lauded, while Elphaba is shunned for being, well, \"different.\" The film suggests that when someone who doesn’t fit the mold — in this case, a literal *green* person — dares to take on power, they’re automatically corrupt. If this doesn’t scream “racial stereotype,” I don’t know what does. It’s as if the creators are trying to suggest that the very act of challenging the existing order (read: white rule) is inherently evil. Spoiler alert: It’s not.\n\n**The Racist Implications of the \"Wicked Witch\" Stereotype** It’s hard to ignore the fact that *Wicked* mirrors the classic \"Wicked Witch\" trope. The character of the \"Wicked Witch of the West\" has always been the embodiment of evil. And let’s be honest: *Wicked* does nothing to dismantle this. The \"Wicked Witch\" is already a figure linked to monstrous, dark, and \"undesirable\" characteristics — but in *Wicked*, she’s colored *green* to drive home just how “other” she is. If we’re being real here, how many witches do we see on screen who aren’t tied to racial or ethnic difference? Almost none.\n\nThis entire franchise forces us to rethink one thing: Can a witch ever be truly wicked if she isn’t breaking some racial boundary? The moment Elphaba stands against the white, blonde, perfect Glinda, we know the outcome. There’s only room for one perfect ideal, and it’s as white as the clouds on a spring day. So, by this logic, *Wicked* tells us that if you’re not blonde and white, you’re just... wicked.\n\n**Conclusion: A World of Green and White** So there we have it: *Wicked*, the musical that serves as a not-so-subtle critique of race, but with a twist. In a world where being “other” is automatically synonymous with being wicked, *Wicked* offers us nothing but tired stereotypes and racially insensitive narratives. From its portrayal of Elphaba as the green-skinned antagonist to Glinda’s almost religious embodiment of whiteness, it’s hard to escape the film’s overt racial messaging. The worst part? It hides all of this behind catchy songs and magical gowns.\n\nIn the end, *Wicked* may have left an impression, but it’s certainly not the kind of impression we need. If we want more films that tackle race and identity thoughtfully, we’ll need to look beyond the whimsical green makeup and question whether the true villain of this story is the narrative itself.",

    "selftext": "https://youtube.com/shorts/i2fkHJdSvIw?si=x2NFGYXOG2OvJc7N\n\nThe Alto Knights - 6/10. Nice to see Barry Levinson back in the direction chair here! He’s made some good movies in the past, but like many other greats, the best days are a bit behind him. The Alto Knights seems to be a movie straight out of the “best of gangster movies” playbook. Any caricature or cliche you can find in a gangster crime film is found here. It got to the point where I was chuckling as to how by the books this movie is. Robert DeNiro seems to be having a ball here, as he gets to play 2 characters here. But these two characters feel like any of the gangsters that DeNiro has played in his long and illustrious career. There’s nothing really new here for him to do, and though he tries his best to differentiate the two with slight body language changes and voice inflections, it just felt like two shades of one character (maybe that was the point). Also awesome to see Debra Messing back here, as I always thought she had great charisma that was never really utilized in a movie (of course she ruled tv sets for a while so I guess there was no need to rule movies). This film was just so on par with any gang movie that it felt just too generic at moments. Its fine for what is, but both Levinson and DeNiro have accomplished way better in the past.",

      "I really like movies of this genre, but Alto Knights just doesn’t make the cut.  DeNiro’s playing two parts is distracting and confusing, imparting a jocularity to the diaphanously thin story line. Too much of the tale is told through Costello’s narration in an obviously poor attempt to emulate the format of The Irishman. The acting is okay as is the cinematography, but I feel ripped off. Levinson is no Scorsese, to be sure, but the question is why did DeNiro participate in this shell game without a pea? But there are some beautiful automobiles of the mid-1950s."

The film follows Renesha ([Brittany S. Hall](https://cinephilecorner.com/cast-and-crew/brittany-s-hall/)) and Evan ([Will Brill](https://cinephilecorner.com/cast-and-crew/will-brill/)), a couple whose relationship initially seems effortless and full of warmth. They meet on a night out, fall in love, move in together, and form a strong bond. Evan, a tattoo artist, encourages Renesha to embrace her individuality, leading her to pursue more fulfilling work and even express herself through body art. Their relationship feels stable, supportive, and genuinely loving.\n\nThat foundation is shattered after a girls’ night out with her friend Amber ([Gail Bean](https://cinephilecorner.com/cast-and-crew/gail-bean/)). Renesha and Amber are approached by two men celebrating a business deal, and after some initial hesitation, they join them for drinks and dancing. A mix of alcohol and edibles later, Renesha wakes up in a stranger’s hotel room, disoriented and unable to remember what happened. When she finally makes it home, Evan is waiting. He immediately insists that they go to a hospital for a rape kit, convinced that she has been assaulted.\n\n[Read More Movie Reviews from Cinephile Corner](https://cinephilecorner.com/a-z-reviews-index/)",

    "selftext": "As a part of the French New Wave Movement, movie show cases the life of Antoine Doniel, a child who was struggling to live and compete with the adversities he had from both his family and school. He lives with his mother and his step father and he spends a night in his home with the daily argument with their parents. He even watches his mother is having an affair and he is also humiliated from both school and from his home. All these chain of events affected him in a way that he finds difficulties in the society and he became unaware about the actions he is taking. It influence him in a way that a kind of I don't care attitude created in him and it then leads him into a hamartia and then into misery. Like I have said the significance of the movie lies in the depiction of societal influence of a child and how the children were treated as a kind of animal. One can also find elements from Italian Neo- realism in the movie, the portrayal of French society reminds me of the movie Bicycle Thieves, which is a classic one. But It deeply goes through the mental state of the child also. Antonie, who failed to find happiness in both his home and school and humiliated consistently find an enjoyment while living in streets, which depicts the innocence of the child. Jean Constantain's also deserves appreciation for that score he had made which pull one deeply into the mysery. Narration and dialogues had a comedy track, but one who watching the movie may find it as a tragedy, like I have said, Antonie's life itself is a hamartia and you will understand it before the movie is going to end.\n\n Follow me on Letterboxd : [https://boxd.it/67lJb](https://boxd.it/67lJb)",

    "title": "A Minecraft Movie REVIEW (MOSTLY SPOILER FREE)",
    "selftext": "With over a decade of cultural dominance and billions of blocks placed, **Minecraft** was always destined for the big screen. Now, it arrives—adapted as a colourful, family-friendly adventure full of action, jokes, and just enough meaning to make you feel like it has more to say than it does. Directed by **Jared Hess**, known for his offbeat sensibilities (*Napoleon Dynamite*), and featuring an ensemble cast including **Jason Momoa** as Garret and **Jack Black** as Steve, 'A Minecraft Movie' arrives with big ambition—but plays things surprisingly safe.\n\n# The Premise\n\nA group of unlikely companions from the real world are transported into a strange, blocky dimension of the Overworld (Minecraft). There, they encounter strange mobs and a new set of rules favouring creativity at the forefront. Early on in their journey, they meet **Steve** (Jack Black) who’s lived in the Minecraft realm for years to escape the pressures of society. He primarily acts as the group's mentor, teaching them the basics of this new world they've found themselves. Together, they face a rising threat of the 'Malgosha' an evil deformed piglin beast who will stop at nothing to destroy the Overworld and creativity as a whole.\n\n# What Works\n\nLet’s be clear: **Kids are going to eat this up.** The characters are usually funny, the energy is high, and the action—especially the climax of the movie which is executed relatively well. Visually, the film does an admirable (although not perfect) job of translating Minecraft’s style into live-action. The world is colourful, full of recognisable elements, and packed with visual callbacks for fans and easter eggs.\n\nJack Black is in full goofy mentor mode, acting as one of the main backbones of the movie. His performance is about what you'd expect, but it still manages to get a laugh now and again through his sheer enthusiasm-which is a shame, because towards the final act of the movie he is a lot more absent due to certain plot developments. This alone removed some of the fun from the movie for me, as in a lot of ways his character was doing quite a lot to hold it together.\n\nThe Minecraft aesthetic is (for the most part) translated with surprising care. The movie doesn’t just look like the game—it often *feels* like it, with tools, mobs, and crafting mechanics incorporated in playful (if surface-level) ways. The cast has a decent amount of chemistry, and younger audiences will likely enjoy the humour, energy, and references to the game. There are also a few heartfelt moments scattered throughout—some more earned than others—that touch on ideas of creativity, teamwork, and identity.\n\nBeneath all the humour and explosions, the movie does try to say something about the value of imagination and collaboration. It doesn't dive deep, but it touches the theme just enough to give younger viewers something to chew on.\n\n# What Doesn’t\n\nThe film is held back by a **by-the-numbers structure** that borrows liberally from recent family hits like *The Lego Movie* and *Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle*. The story structure is extremely familiar.  The arcs and themes are ones you've seen in many family adventures before—complete with a villain whose motivations are quite literally to destroy creativity. Yes, that’s really his motivation. Along with characters who don’t always get the development they deserve.\n\nCertain characters, like **Dawn** and **VP Marlene**, are immensely stereotypical, and primarily used for comic relief, which works in moments, but sometimes comes at the cost of emotional depth. While **Garret**’s and **Steve's** personal journey's are given some attention, the broader themes are handled with a light touch that never quite delivers a satisfying payoff.\n\nTone-wise, the live-action approach occasionally clashes with the world’s inherent silliness. There are moments where it feels like the film is stuck between somewhat grounded storytelling and animated absurdity—and it never fully commits to either, with even the CGI lacking in some areas.\n\n# The Jared Hess Factor\n\nThis isn’t the Jared Hess of Napoleon Dynamite—not really. A few moments of awkward humour and deadpan line delivery slip-through, but overall, it feels like the director was hired for his indie quirk and then boxed in by the demands of a blockbuster IP. His signature tone is largely buried under action sequences and studio polish.\n\n# Final Verdict\n\nIt’s bright, watchable, and full of familiar beats—but it rarely surprises. For younger viewers and lighter fans, it may be enough. But for those hoping for a bold, imaginative take on one of gaming’s most creative properties, this is more prebuilt than player-made.\n\nEven the emotional payoff—especially in the final moments where everything ties back to the real world—feels a little rushed. There are hints of something meaningful, even mythic, but it’s mostly left at the surface level. Despite this, it can still be a fun movie if you shut your brain off a little.\n\n**Rating:** ★★★☆☆\n\n**For kids:** Fun enough.  \n**For longtime fans:** Mostly surface-level.  \n**For general audiences:** Predictable and safe.  \n**For Minecraft’s creative legacy:** Underwhelming.",

    "selftext": "https://youtu.be/mnaETrzOXcA?si=a7La2lGAhveevEVM\n\nSnow White - 5.5/10. Alright, so, I ended up watching Snow White. This movie’s well documented production is now going to be referred to by many for years to come. And if you have preconceived notions about something before watching it, chances are you’re not going to be able to brush those prior thoughts aside. For me, I’ve sort of checked out from watching Disney animated/live action films in recent years. Don’t know why, but I haven’t been caring for these remakes/reboots/sequels to beloved classics. If anything, Disney should just hire whoever is creating the Pixar films, give them carte blanche ability, and let them make whatever comes to mind. Their golden era was full of films that were original, different, and felt like breathes of fresh air. Ironically, Pixar and other animation studios seem to be doing what Disney used to do. I really did want to see this film, just to form my own opinion. Now, is this as terrible as people are saying it to be? No, but it’s sadly a flawed film. Which is shocking, because Marc Webb is a good director. But it seems like Webb and his team had to reconstruct this movie at times, because it feels like they wanted to make two different movies at certain points. For a big film, it’s production values look a tad off or not great at times. The performances are a little all over the place. Rachel Zegler’s performance is okay, but I feel that she really and truly shines in the singing portions. She has an incredible voice, and I feel like her performance really worked during the song portions. Unfortunately for her, her performance is hampered due to the writing and having not that great chemistry with her love interest. Gal Gadot is really hamming it up here. I get that she was attempting to do the classic villain performance, what with over the top hand gestures, eyebrow raising smirks and over the top dialogue delivery. But I feel like she sadly doesn’t hit the mark on this attempt here. The CGI here is impeccable for the animals (probably my other favourite thing about this film outside of Zegler’s singing). The animals are super adorable and ironically help make their respective scenes better. The CGI for the dwarves is really hit or miss (mostly miss). They look better than when the trailer dropped, but it still feels like something out of a video game to be frank. The changes to the story are not as jarring as people were saying it to be, but I felt that the overall product that this film is just feels like its not able to hit its stride. Its one of those movies that I wonder if there’s a director’s cut that shows a different vision. Either way, Snow White sadly is not up to par. It’s not bad, but certainly could’ve been a lot better as well!",

    "selftext": "I’m always a sucker for the unlikely hero, the bystander to history who gets swept up in something he can’t quite define, but all the same rises to the occasion. Pautasso, a portly textile factory proletarian, breaks from Official Routine and sounds the work stoppage whistle an hour earlier than it’s supposed to. He and his fellow workers’ reasoning is that a 13 hour work day, instead of a 14 hour work day, would lead to fewer arms getting mangled in those monstrous steaming gears. You have to start somewhere.\n\nSo begins the awakening of a downtrodden, sullen people in Mario Monicelli’s *“The Organizer,”* a highly entertaining two hour polemic. Despite receiving a sort of semi-official endorsement from the Italian Socialist Party, it contains the germs of far more radical ideas than the tepid reformism offered by the ISP in the 1960’s. At risk of sounding ridiculous, the lexicon of their lives will be altered forever by the strike.\n\nAway with “signore,” “The Don,” endless paeans to the Virgin Mary or the local political heavies. Replace them with “comrade,” “exploitation,” “strike committee,” “surplus value,” even “reproductive labor.” A liberated people speaks louder, obviously, but the vocabulary must change as well. Paulo Freire once said education becomes liberatory when the dispossessed rewrite definitions for commonly used words; Monnicelli answers with “Yes, and they will be very funny while doing it.”\n\n[*Continue reading here...*](https://cinemawavesblog.com/film-reviews/the-organizer-1963-review-and-analysis/)\n\n",

In this world, artificial intelligence has taken over most prestigious jobs, and human emotions are seen as liabilities. If she wants a well-compensated career, she must erase her strong feelings, eliminating the possibility of human error. But as she navigates these past lives, she keeps encountering Louis, forming a connection so intense that it feels as though she has always known him.\n\n[Bonello](https://cinephilecorner.com/cast-and-crew/bertrand-bonello/), always an experimental filmmaker, takes *The Beast* into deeply layered and cerebral territory, blending elements of *Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind* and *Her* with the grand, interwoven storytelling of *Cloud Atlas* and *Vanilla Sky*. At times, the film evokes the dreamy, fractured logic of [David Lynch](https://cinephilecorner.com/lists/david-lynch-movies-ranked/), while its meditations on love and desire recall [Claire Denis](https://cinephilecorner.com/cast-and-crew/claire-denis/). The film’s first immersion sequence, set in 1910 France, even conjures images of *Titanic*, as Gabrielle and Louis find themselves trapped in a flooding doll-making factory.\n\n[Read More Movie Reviews from Cinephile Corner](https://cinephilecorner.com/)",

Performance was another positive thing I have found good in this movie, I can say that it was Basil's career best performance till now. I think this movie bring changes to Basil what 'Maheshinte Prathikaaram' did to Fahadh Faasil. Sajin Gopu's performance also deserves appreciation, he pull off such a terrible looking character by himself after he did 'Amban' in Aavesham. The beauty of that place was brilliantly captured and the movie also goes through many subjects such as dowry and geniusly illustrates the village and people. The narration movie had which starts as a simple movie which we thought it will be a typical comedy movie then gradually become more intense and raw, the transformation which depicted well in the movie. How politics influence the youth, unemployment and how heavly people are depends on dowry is also portrayed. Some frames and shots are so good, kudos to the cinematographer for capturing such a beautiful village.

    "selftext": "After being affected by the pandemic and the SAG-AFTRA strike, Disney’s live-action remake of the 1937 Snow White—the studio’s first-ever animated feature—finally hit cinemas in March 2025, nine years after its announcement. The lead-up to its release was anything but smooth as it carried the weight of online controversies involving its two lead actresses, mostly tied to political opinions and a clumsy, immature critique of the original film. Still, Disney set out to bring the almost 90-year-old classic to modern audiences—and in some ways, they kind of did.\n\nThe result lands right in the middle of the studio’s remake spectrum—somewhere between the extremely faithful (The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast) and the more imaginative reinterpretations (Cinderella, Pete’s Dragon). And while the two approaches sometimes feel like they’re fighting each other, the end result manages to please both sides.\n\nOn one side, you get overly respectful recreations that force the dwarfs to look like exaggerated 1930s cartoon characters. The CGI results are a bit odd—somewhere between creepy and charming, very much like Spielberg’s The BFG—but surprisingly, they work. There’s also a great updated version of the 1937 film’s most famous tune, Heigh-Ho, though its iconic ballad Some Day My Prince Will Come is nowhere to be found. The structure and story beats are mostly unchanged, but there are some meaningful updates: the prince is now a Robin Hood–style love interest with a name and a purpose, there are new songs by Pasek and Paul (of The Greatest Showman, Dear Evan Hansen, and Aladdin’s Speechless)—which are actually pretty good, aside from the villain number, All Is Fair—and Snow White herself finally has some real personality.\n\n\nRead my full review at: https://reviewsonreels.ca/2025/03/21/disney-snow-white/",

And the Choreography for some of the songs were all right, like how the Queens Maids are dancing during her evil villain number\n\nNow for the Bad.\n\nThe Dwarves in the movie will haunt me, for the rest of my life, they are uncanny as he'll, there is no soul behind their eyes, I think The Xenomorph from Aliens looks friendlier than the Dwarves. Gal Gadot is so bland in this movie  it makes her in Wonder Woman 1985 look good, I get she's supposed to be a 1 dimensional evil queen and that's fine, bit at least he entertaining.\n\nSpeaking of Entertaining,  The songs...We're not entertaining at all, I was so bored, when a musical number came up, I'd put my ear buds in after they were halfway through the only song I semi-ebjoyed was 'Princess Problems' that's it, everything else in this movie was made by the CIA to torture prisoners in Guatonomo Bay (I probably spelt that wrong), and Sbow White herself, is also, bland, now the original Sbow White is a very bland character,  but at least she could sing, Rachel Zegler was given the worst songs I feel, because I could not tell you a single lyric from any of her songs, I understand that this movie is made for kids, but I wouldn't make a child  watch this, I'm not that cruel of a person. I watched this movie for a discounted price...And I want a full refund because this movie was just, so bland, there was no substance, it's like eating Tofu, no flavor, and it leaves a sad feeling in your mouth after you eat it.\n\nAll and all, great set designs, great costumes, everything else was just...Boring, bland, and just disappointing like all of Disney's 'Live Action' CGI reboots,  don't  take your kids to this movie.",

It’s unsettling, mysterious, and deeply restrained in a way that few modern horror films manage to be. While [*Longlegs*](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/longlegs-movie-2024/) attempted a similar eerie, slow-burn approach, *The Blackcoat’s Daughter* executes its vision with razor-sharp precision, maintaining an indie aesthetic that enhances its creeping dread. Unlike many recent horror films that rely on overt plot twists or exaggerated performances, this one thrives on pure atmosphere, smart craftsmanship, and even smarter performances.\n\nThe film follows two students stranded at an all-girls prep school over winter break. [Lucy Boynton](https://cinephilecorner.com/cast-and-crew/lucy-boynton/)’s Rose is a senior, seemingly the most grounded character in the story, grappling with a pregnancy scare while reluctantly looking after freshman Kat ([Kiernan Shipka](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/twisters-movie-2024/)). Kat, however, exudes an unshakable unease—she speaks slowly, reacts in a detached manner, and carries an aura of quiet menace.

Meanwhile, Joan ([Emma Roberts](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/madame-web-movie-2024/)), a troubled young woman with an unclear past, hitchhikes toward the school, her story unfolding in a way that suggests something sinister is at play.\n\n[Read More Reviews from Cinephile Corner](https://cinephilecorner.com/)",

    "selftext": "https://youtu.be/n2mcL53RkrI?si=Sst2Ng8ahjdwMOCi\n\nBob Trevino Likes It - 10/10. I guess I'm on a roll in terms of watching good films recently. Or, 2025's slate is finally kicking in high gear. Either way, I wasn't expecting to be this emotional watching this film. I was expecting a dramedy that had its light and dark moments, but what I ended up with is a beautiful human drama that felt like a therapy session (in a good way). Bob Trevino Likes It is similar to the film \"I Love My Dad,\" which was also a film that bases its plot around a real life situation that the director had experienced. This is one of those movies that shows the importance of interaction and compassion. Its also a film that shows you that making a genuine connection really does matter (even if its something as simple as talking). We have two characters here that are seeking something. One is seeking for a stable and compassionate father figure, while the other is inadvertently becoming a father figure when in his past he lost the chance to be one. Through this chance Facebook friendship, we see how this heartwarming connection creates a beautiful change in each other's lives. Barbie Ferreira and John Leguizamo are both stellar here. These are performances which won't possibly win awards, but they are layered and beautifully done performances that help enhance the meaning of the film. I think in general, being compassionate and being present and thoughtful manner. A genuine friendship and connection goes a long way, and what this film shows is that the little things really do help people grow and become more human. Its a film that might escape your mind after a while, but it will make you feel a lot of beautiful emotions. Wasn't expecting to tear up at the end, but boy did it hit hard. Beautiful indie film, which reminds you of the good that is in the world when offer a helping hand and when we listen.\n",

      "This is my favorite movie I’ve seen this year so far. But this year’s movies are so fantastic. I agree. Opus, The Assessment, The Ballad of Wallis Island were all great. I also have enjoyed the more main stream movies I’ve seen, Death of a Unicorn, Mickey 17, even with It’s flaws I enjoyed Love Hurts. Today and tomorrow in I'm seeing The Friend and The Penguin Lesson which I think are going to be great. So happy we’re getting more movies without all the special effects and gimmicks. Hopefully Anora winning the Oscar we’ll get more independent/lower budget films with a good story and strong characters. I personally prefer a movie like Bob Trevino over another superhero movie. And don’t get me wrong. Superhero movies have their place and obviously make a lot of money. But happy to see lower budget films making a small rise in the theaters."

It will remind you of any movie involving cults or anything where there’s a charismatic leader who has nefarious motivations. It feels like The Menu meets Midsommar meets god knows what else movies that have come out in the last decade or so that fit in this bill. John Malkovich is having a ball here, and it seems he relishes playing these roles to a tee. Its nice to see Juliette Lewis back, and Ayo does a good job with what she has to work with. But I feel like the familiarity of the story just made it feel like a drag at times. Sure, the horror element and the inadvertent realization by the lead at the end of the movie was a nice touch. But, I just feel like the film’s motivations and mystery kind of cloud it from being at its true potential at times. There’s an interesting story here which Malkovich’s character touches upon in his last scene in the film. He talks about how the bigger the fame an individual receives, the more they can get away with. Had the film zeroed in on that premise and focused on how much horror can delve from that, then maybe, this movie would’ve been far more interesting and possibly sinister. But we are left with a film that just feels like a shell of other great movies. Okay at best.",

    "title": "Black Bag (2025) Review: Steven Soderbergh’s Sleek, Sexy, Spy Suspenser is a Success",
    "selftext": "In his second feature of 2025, Steven Soderbergh shows off how deep his *Black Bag* is, crafting an elaborate mystery around a British intelligence software called Severus being stolen, and Michael Fassbender as George is tasked to find out by who. As one of the top intelligence officers in the game, it should be no problem, but everything twists when all signs point to the culprit being his wife Kathryn, played by Cate Blanchett. \n\nThis is a mystery that plays out pretty satisfyingly, but at points, it feels like it holds too much back. *Black Bag* jumps right into the plot, as within minutes of sitting down we find out that Severus is stolen and a list of agents including Kathryn are suspects. If Severus gets out, thousands can die. What is Severus? What do they do for work? The movie slowly drip-feeds the audience information, but as the movie progresses, I feel as if the drip of information does not keep up. It isn’t until the reveal of who stole Severus does it makes sense. Normally, a movie will leave some breadcrumbs along the way that point to who did it, but I didn’t notice anything here. I was already planning a rewatch, but it would’ve been a more satisfying rewatch to go back and see the clues that I had missed. The movie throws a lot of twists at you which makes it an unpredictable ride, but it’s thrilling the entire time.\n\nWhen I first saw the trailer for this movie, my immediate reaction was, “It’s funny that the point of this movie is how this couple’s marriage is the most important thing in the world, but they cast the two androids in that role.” I didn’t mean that in the derogatory sense, but Fassbender and Blanchett aren’t the types of people who seem to be all lovey-dovey. That was exactly the point of the movie. Multiple times, people ask George how he and Kathryn can make their relationship work and prioritize each other above all else, and he reiterates how it works because they are in lockstep with each other. Even though she says she’d lie to him if she had to, there is an unspoken boundary between them that allows them to carry out their job tasks on each other, no questions asked. They are both extremely calculated and cold when they need to be, making them a perfect match for each other. \n\nThe movie is shot and scored incredibly sleek. Soderbergh excels at keeping his movies concise and eliminating the fluff. The opening sequence follows George as he walks through an alley, then levels of a bar and nightclub as he finds his source who tells him about the leak, and it is a beautiful unbroken long take. The score is slick and upbeat, matching the tense action unfolding in front of us. Even though there isn’t much action during this movie, it still is incredibly tense and stressful. Everyone is dressed incredibly as well. You can tell the level of detail taken to make each person stand out and it shows. \n\nRead our final thoughts and see our score here: [https://firstpicturehouse.com/black-bag-2025-review-steven-soderberghs-sleek-sexy-spy-suspenser-is-a-success/](https://firstpicturehouse.com/black-bag-2025-review-steven-soderberghs-sleek-sexy-spy-suspenser-is-a-success/)",

    "selftext": "https://youtube.com/shorts/98cwVi0LrZ8?si=jELaOF86xMSbNNtr\n\nThe Day The Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie - 10/10. Throughout the illustrious and incredible history of the Looney Tunes, its shocking and surprising that it took them 95 years (not kidding) for them to make a full length feature that is fully animated! Of course, we had the Space Jam films and Back In Action, so we’ve gotten Looney Tunes movies, but they’ve been live action/animation hybrids! But, we finally get the fully animated treatment here with this wonderful flick starring two of the greatest Looney characters. You would think that making this big achievement would want the studio to shoehorn Bugs Bunny or some of the other highly major characters in their catalogue to be the leads. But I appreciate their decision to have Daffy Duck and Porky Pig here, as they make for a wonderful and hilarious opposites attract tag team of hilarity. The story is a bonkers one, but one that also pays homage to classic Sci-Fi flicks and to old Looney shorts as well. You got aliens (nice twist on the villain’s arc), you got a tale about friendship, overcoming obstacles, love, etc. It’s all packaged into a zany and super fun tale! Along with the fun and fast nature of the film, I was genuinely surprised (but not shocked) at the surprisingly mature humour at times. That was one of the big things I appreciated about Looney Tunes growing up: it felt more edgy and it felt like they were going for it and not playing it safe. As a huge Looney Tunes fan growing up (and still being a big fan till this day), its awesome to see this on the big screen, and also hearing Scarborough’s own Eric Bauza being the voice of a lot of the characters. This is a movie that is made strictly for fans, but it works fine as an entry piece for anyone whose never seen Looney Tunes before. Fun filled and just great entertainment!",

    "selftext": "Every man faces a dilemma in life: Should he prioritize his personal life, or his commitment to the people around him? The one who chooses the latter becomes a leader, while the other remains an ordinary man—perhaps fishing, running a business, or even writing reviews.\n\nThandel tells the story of a man who chooses his commitment to his fellow fishermen over his personal desires. When the woman he loves pleads with him to stop venturing into the dangerous seas, Thandel, the protagonist and a natural leader, makes the difficult decision to leave her at the railway station and join his crew on their journey to a coastal town for fishing. Trouble arises when they accidentally cross into Pakistani waters.\n\nThe fishermen are arrested and imprisoned alongside hardened criminals in a Pakistani jail. They endure humiliation from both the jail authorities and the inmates, who mock their patriotism and subject them to violence. Despite the harsh conditions, Thandel remains a pillar of strength, keeping the morale of his fellow fishermen high. In a moment of defiance, he even confronts and defeats the leader of the abusive prisoners. Months pass, and their situation seems hopeless.\n\nBack in the village, the woman Thandel left behind witnesses the financial struggles of the fishermen’s families. Determined to help, she confronts a business owner who owes the fishermen money and successfully pressures him to release the funds. While this provides some relief, the families continue to wait for their loved ones to return. She then takes their plight to Delhi, advocating for their release with government officials. Eventually, the Indian and Pakistani governments negotiate, and the fishermen are set to be released.\n\nHowever, due to a technical error, one fisherman’s name is missing from the release list. Thandel refuses to leave unless every single one of his crew is freed. His unwavering stance earns the support of his fellow fishermen, and ultimately, all of them are released.\n\nA subplot explores the emotional turmoil of the woman Thandel left behind. Hurt by his decision, she considers marrying someone else, but her love for him remains. Without giving too much away, the film concludes on a heartwarming note.\n\nThe cinematography shines in the scenes of the boat battling turbulent seas, capturing the peril and intensity of the fishermen’s lives. The village scenes are equally authentic, grounding the story in a realistic setting. However, the performances of the main actors could have been more compelling, as they occasionally fall short of conveying the depth of their characters’ emotions.\n\nOverall, Thandel is a poignant tale of sacrifice, leadership, and resilience, with a strong emotional core and visually striking moments. While the acting may not always hit the mark, the film’s message and storytelling make it a worthwhile watch.",

    "selftext": "“Last Breath” (2025) is director Alex Parkinson’s film adaptation of his documentary “Last Breath” (2019) which he co-directed with Richard da Costa. It seems much of the same team from the documentary hopped over to help make the film version including composer Paul Leonard-Morgan. Why tell the same story in two very similar formats? Did you get it wrong the first time? After seeing the film, my instinct tells me this cannot be an improvement over the first iteration, though I have not seen the documentary.\n\nA routine sailing into the North sea for gas pipeline maintenance is already a dangerous job without any complications. Divers Dave-not-David Yuasa (Simu Liu) and loving fiancé Chris Lemmons (Finn Cole) descend to replace pipeline on the sea floor when the ship loses control of its rutters, sending it drifting on the turbulent swells. The captain of the ship (Cliff Curtis) prioritizes finding Chris while avoiding an environmental disaster of pipeline rupture. Tethered to a smaller, attached vessel, Chris and Dave are tugged along the sea floor until Chris’s tether (umbilical cord) snags on equipment at their job site and snaps off, depriving him of ship-supplied oxygen and communication. Duncan (Woody Harrelson) can only watch and try whatever he can to save their stranded coworker. With limited oxygen and freezing temperatures, the ship must find a way to get back to Chris before his time is up.\n\nOh, where to start… After watching this film, it feels as though Parkinson started with clichés, stuffed them into templates, and wrapped them all up into runtime padding. The film is somewhat competently made on the technical side, aside from wobbly drone footage. On the side of writing, acting, directing, cinematography, and music, the film is just poorly done. I never fault actors for bad writing, but I just felt that nobody really cared about the film they were making. There’s really not much for the actors to go on other than to put on a mask of concern, some wet eyeballs, and say “no he’s not” for ninety minutes. This is not a film where you really get to know the characters, just the major event that defines their lifetimes. This is a very sterile film.\n\nLeonard-Morgan’s music started the film with very uninspired tunes. I was in shock, hearing what I thought was royalty-free stock music with some sonar pings slapped in. These tracks serenaded the opening credits for a boring amount of time where we got to see so much of nothing going on. Yes, I’m sure it was very important that we saw Chris get two bottles of hot sauce and have awkward first-take material hallway banter about a pink room.\n\nYou can tell everything was filmed in a studio with green screen and which exteriors were CGI and which were drone shots. From the moment we meet Chris and his fiancé, we know he will be the one to face danger by the laziest “he’s gonna die, isn’t he?” shot that I have seen in recent memory. I can’t say I was ever caught up in the moment.\n\nPart of this is because there is an overall lack of tension. Nobody on board the ship or in the smaller vessel is fighting amongst themselves. There’s no shady corporation that could have at least added some pressure. Everyone is friends and everyone collaborates with the same moral compass. The only moments of tension come from pure action sequences where the stakes are primally of life and death.\n\nIn a mostly good scene, Dave climbs the umbilical cord back to the smaller vessel with Chris, whose vitals are uncertain, but urgency dominates the scene. All the while, the violent swells of the stormy North sea cause problems with climbing. The film’s language isn’t built to induce tension or have you guessing. I think this is a symptom of the sickness of overfamiliarity with the material. It really feels as if the filmmakers have gotten sick of the material and are now conveying what they think is necessary for the audience to understand what’s going on, but they skip through all the good stuff and linger on the already stagnant stuff. The story could have been good, but the filmmakers didn’t seem to know what the story was or even how to find it in the edit.\n\nI’m left with my impression of an amateur production that feels very cheesy, bland, and rote. It feels like a lazy cash-grab capitalizing on other peoples’ struggles that only seems to prioritize its runtime and getting released in theaters. In the hands of a more capable filmmaker, this easily could’ve been a two-hour nail-biter. I’m just wondering what I’m doing watching this movie instead of watching the documentary.\n\n  \n2/5 stars",

    "selftext": "In its best moments, Revelations captures the unbearable suspense of some of the best Breaking Bad episodes. This new Netflix original from director Yeon Sang-ho (who has yet to recapture the same mainstream success after his fantastic Train to Busan) is incredibly efficient at building tension and pushing its characters into deeper and darker corners as the film progresses. It also explores a fascinating character arc: a pastor—much like Walter White—breaking bad, this time because he believes the signs he’s receiving are messages from God.\n\nThe movie centers on Pastor Min-chan (played by Ryu Jun-yeol), a young and hardworking church leader who’s been growing his congregation despite mounting marital problems. One day, a man with a violent criminal past visits the church while following a young girl. Min-chan becomes convinced that capturing this man is his divine mission. At the same time, Detective Yeon-hee is assigned to the case, but she has a personal connection—her sister was murdered by this same man. What follows is a tense game of cat and mouse between the three.\n\nRead my full review at https://reviewsonreels.ca/2025/03/21/revelations-2025/",

      "The most impressive aspect of the movie is role of that the devil plays. Although not a casted character, its influence as the \"tempter\" and \"tester\" is what really underlines all of the motivations of the characters. The movie is to be enjoyed by both ends of the spectrum of 'faith'. It leaves beautiful commentary on the theology of \"divine calling\" and intertwines how the world works within a system usually excluded from any media portrayal because of being sensitive to its followers. Here however both sides are appreciated and are actually combined to bring forth the dramatic, al be it, second climax of the film. 5/5",
      "Jun yeol never fails to give a great performance. Loved seeing him as a psycho this time haha. Overall, it's a pretty good film.",
      "No 4k release?",
      "in that movie they say about that 1 eye. it feels like masonry. its only my opinion",
      "What the hell was with the end. Made me think that jesus forced him to sin lol.",
      "I think it depends on your interpretation of the movie. Was God really guiding him the entire time and orchestrating the events so the man died AND the girl was saved? Or were the signs warning from God, telling him he was sinning? After all that Deuteronomy verse, angel in the clouds, and all the other images he saw could have been interpreted the opposite way. Stop, you're sinning. Let the ambulance come. You kidnapped that man you will be punished. Or it could have been a string of coincidences like the psychiatrist said, just Apophenia and his guilty conscious seeing shapes and patterns as Revelations to excuse his own sinning \n\n\nOption one: God reveals himself to the pastor in the wall, reaffirming he's still on the path God wanted, and that it was indeed his divine mission to kill him. Her being alive was also his will even if the pastor didn't understand his entire plan. He's cracking mentally but ultimately right. God's will is mysterious, sometimes following his plan leads to suffering but a true believer follows it regardless, etc etc \n\n\nOption Two: God showed himself one last time, indicating he's being punished by god's will because he didn't listen to the warning signs. His broken mind refuses to believe this and he lies to himself.\n\n\nOption three: He feels crushing guilt and suffers a crisis of faith at the news that the girl was alive. God wouldn't have left the girl to die, taking him to kill the man. In his broken state he sees the grime on wall and starts scrubbing, desperate to see what he needs to see to assuage himself of his own guilt. Convinced himself it was God's plan.",
      "I thought when he scrubbed the “Jesus” shape on the wall it turned into the grinning devil. Like all those “signs” he’s been seeing were the devil’s doing all along? Even if there’s no such sign and he was seeing the stuff cos of his condition, he now have crisis of faith so he started seeing the devil, convinced that he’s been tricked, or blaming the devil altogether.",
      "I saw it as a sign / warning that god is always watching. The second time he sees the angelic figure in the clouds was a second chance at redemption and repenting for his sin as he hasn’t killed anyone yet.\n\nThe last time he sees Jesus on the wall is once again a reminder that god is indeed always watching and no matter how hard he wipes it wont go away. “You can’t wash the blood off your hands”.",
      "Yes definitely grinning devil it was shown."

    "selftext": "**\"A Raw and Unflinching Descent into Obsession\"**  \n  \nAs a longtime fan of bodybuilding, someone who watches events like Mr. Olympia and the Arnold Classic every year, I understand the intense discipline and sacrifice it takes to chase greatness in the sport. Magazine Dreams taps into that world, but instead of glamorizing it, the film explores the darker, more isolating aspects of ambition through the eyes of Killian Maddox.  \n  \nJonathan Majors delivers a haunting and transformative performance as Killian, a man singularly focused on becoming the world’s top bodybuilder. But this isn’t just a story about muscle and drive. It's a deep character study of obsession, identity, and the desperate need for validation. Killian idolizes a particular bodybuilding figure, bordering on unhealthy worship, and begins molding himself in that image, both physically and emotionally. Along the way, we witness his battle not only with the limitations of his body, but with deep-seated trauma and social isolation that stem from a troubled past.  \n  \nThe film doesn’t pull punches. It’s uncomfortable, even cringeworthy at times, not because it’s poorly done, but because Majors inhabits Killian with such intensity that it feels real, raw, and unsettling. You don't walk away from this movie feeling good—but you do walk away thinking. It’s a film that lingers.  \n  \nIf you appreciated the psychological weight of Joker (2019) or the gritty realism of Taxi Driver, you’ll find Magazine Dreams in similar emotional territory. It’s a heavy watch, but an important one, and arguably Jonathan Majors’ most nuanced performance to date.  \n  \n**Rating: 8.5 / 10**",

    "selftext": "Few awards contenders have stirred up as much controversy in recent years as *\"Emilia Perez\"* did. The ambitious musical drama from acclaimed French filmmaker **Jacques Audiard** (*\"A Prophet\"*, *\"Rust and Bone\"*) won 3 Cannes Film Festival trophies (Jury Prize, Best Composer and Best Actress for its ensemble cast of actresses) and was also nominated for the Queer Palm and Palme d'Or. It then went on to nab 10 Golden Globe nods, winning 4, 11 BAFTA nominations, winning Best Film not in the English language and Supporting Actress (**Zoe Saldana**), and last but not least, 13 Academy Awards nominations, of which it won two (Original Song and Supporting Actress). But it also sparked a firestorm of outrage that ranged from Culture War shenanigans that somehow brought both sides together against the movie, to accusations of inaccurate or stereotypical depictions of Mexican culture and even indignation against the use of AI to enhance the on-screen singing. *\"Emilia Perez\"* quickly transitioned from awards darling into everyone's favorite punching bag.

    "title": "Honest, Non-Spoiler Review: Snow White 2025 is Delightful, Enchanting, and Maybe a Bit Too Uncomplicated",
    "selftext": "Just finished watching Marc Webb's reimagined *Snow White*, and I must say I genuinely enjoyed it. First, I want to say that no, this review is NOT sponsored by anyone, and yes, I am very much a fan of musicals and Disney live-actions.\n\nI also want to acknowledge that yes, I'm aware of the \"controversies\" (and the bashing and trolling) this film has amassed for as long as its conception. I will NOT participate in those, as I will be keeping my review only about my experience watching the movie itself.\n\nAnyways, on to my review...\n\nThere's definitely much to love about this adaptation. There's no denying that Rachel Zegler *is* the star of the show. Her powerful, dulcet voice really carries Snow White's emotions through the screen. Her musical performance is impeccable and enjoyable, and her acting is very much compelling. She *is* Snow White, and no amount of bashing, hating, or trolling can change that. If anything, Zegler has become even more of a Snow White in real life, with all the bashing she's been getting because of who she is and her beliefs, and the way she's been handling them. She is graceful, and she has integrity.\n\nGal Gadot definitely *looks* the Evil Queen. However, her musical performance is a bit stiff. It feels almost like she's only casted because she *looks* the Evil Queen. There's no denying that Gadot is a great actor, but her singing and dancing are a bit questionable. Her performance does not shine as much as Zegler, and I'm as much disappointed myself for saying that. I wanted her so much to be the evilest queen of all, but, alas, she falls short in the musical performance.\n\nAndrew Burnap, the \"prince charming\", or should I say the \"not a prince but still charming\" lover of Snow White, is definitely a surprise for me. I've never seen him in any films before, so didn't know much about his acting capabilities, but I was pleasantly surprised by his performance—and by his conventional \"prince charming\" look. He definitely sold it for me.\n\nThe CGI dwarves make a lot of sense. No, they're not grotesque or scary. No, this movie is not anti-little people (you'll see). In fact the dwarves are adorable, especially Dopey! The film really did a great job mixing humans and CGI characters/creatures together. It did not feel like I was being taken out of the story by the CGI at all. In fact, the details and the oddities make them believable, even more interesting.\n\nThe songs/musical numbers are absolutely catchy and relatable! They'll definitely make you want to dance on your seat, or hum the songs with them, or get teary eyed (like me). The only ones I didn't enjoyed as much were the Evil Queen's. Again, I thought Gadot was a bit awkward.\n\nThe story/plot itself is quintessential Disney: light, enchanting, uncomplicated. It is very much a good-versus-evil movie. Perhaps a little too uncomplicated. I wanted to see more of the Evil Queen's backstory, and whatever happened to Snow White's father, the King. But I'm sure that would've been too much for the Disney purists.\n\nI would give this movie 4/5 stars for musical, Disney live-action standard. The film is enchanting, Zegler is compelling, the songs/musical performance are captivating. (*Wicked* has set the bar quite high for musicals.) But really, I urge you to see this film, if only for curiosity or even for love of the old school Disney magic.",

      "I knew it couldn’t be as bad as they said. I was planning to watch it anyways, but now this makes me feel better. I heard Zegler’s singing on a YouTube short and knew at least that part has to be good. I feel like a big Bollywood star would have been a fun choice for the evil queen instead of Gadot. I’d love to see more international talent for these big Disney films."

    "title": "The Rule of Jenny Pen",
    "selftext": "The primary source of enjoyment from *The Rule of Jenny Pen* comes from watching two veteran scene-stealers like John Lithgow and Geoffrey Rush go at each other.  Lithgow has portrayed  memorable psychopaths before (*Raising Cain*, Showtime’s *Dexter*), but never one like Dave Crealy.  Malicious and vicious, he’s a vengeful id with no restraint or remorse.  As his sparring partner, Rush is more than up to the challenge.  He plays Stefan Mortensen as haughty and generally insufferable, a man who’s accustomed to getting his way until his body betrays him.  Seeing them throw punches like heavyweight boxers was a treat, something I rarely see in movies these days.\n\nThe movie is particularly effective as a psychological horror story because it grounds the action within a genuinely terrifying reality.  It focuses on how any of us can go from living a normal life to being trapped in a thoroughly depressing situation in an instant.  The journey Rush’s character takes reminded me of Dante’s Inferno, where his character experience grows worse and worse as time goes on, with no chance for escape.  After seeing this movie, I’m surprised that there haven’t been more films that exploit the fears we all have of being forced to live in a nursing home.\n\nWhile writer-director James Ashcroft is certainly fortunate to have Rush and Lithgow in the leading roles, he isn’t content to sit back and watch their fireworks.  Ashcroft’s off-kilter direction captures the overwhelmingly depressing aspects of the nursing home environment, consisting of faded, nondescript rooms, unending hallways and dingy personal care facilities.  Within this nightmare landscape he shocks us with a brutally honest depiction of the daily lives of the residents, who alternate between long periods of monotony and acute moments of terror.  Finally, he succeeds in transforming the puppet into the most disturbing baby toy I’ve seen in a movie since *Toy Story 3*.\n\n*The Rule of Jenny Pen* is a savagely funny little horror movie.  Although you’ll need to suspend your disbelief on more than one occasion, the film’s merits more than make up for its lapses.  The gripping performances by Geoffrey Rush and John Lithgow alone make it worth watching.  **Recommended**.\n\n[https://detroitcineaste.net/2025/03/20/the-rule-of-jenny-pen-review-and-analysis-geoffrey-rush-john-lithgow/](https://detroitcineaste.net/2025/03/20/the-rule-of-jenny-pen-review-and-analysis-geoffrey-rush-john-lithgow/)",

    "title": "Terrorizers (1986)",
    "selftext": "Director- Edward Yang.\nThis is the second film by the director that I have seen.\nI had previously seen Yi Yi which featured family in a major role, which is quite different in its content to this film which features several themes against family.\nThe film follows the protagonist as he deals with a choice that could benefit him but will make him betray his friend.\nThe film has several stories that intertwine and share characters. This makes the film quite interesting and engaging.\nThis film reminded me of Unknown Pleasures of Jia Zhangke with the city playing an important role. The film also features the use of pan shots as a way to show us events occurring simultaneously. We also see violence being committed in a non-voyeuristic way by the people. The feel of the scenes having a sense of peace as in its an everyday occurrence alleviated the scenes even more.\nTerrorizers feature the protagonist who works in a science-related field being in line for a promotion along with his best friend. His wife is a writer who is cheating on him with the person who offered her a job. At the same time there is another story going on of a photographer and a girl who has to use crutches to walk due to an injury.\nThe way the mundanity of life is shown to us makes us ease into the film a lot better and its pacing makes it an introspective and meditative watch that manages to not be boring at all through the use of conflict being sprinkled into it.\nThe way the tone shifts to more action-focused at times and violence-focused towards the end is phenomenal. This film is a masterclass on how to ease into tonal changes and not make it appear forced.\nThe sequences post the wife's disappearance show us how devoted the husband is quite well while setting up the ending part as well.\nHis betraying his friend through wrongful accusations sets up his drive well enough and shows us how far he will go to get what he wants no matter the cost. His acting as if he knows nothing about what happened in front of his friend makes him seem sociopathic if not for his fidgety nature.\nThe way police brutality is shown to us near the start with the person clicking photos of them beating up a person trying to run away is interesting. It also sets up how he is bound to be at the wrong place, at the wrong time and will unknowingly record something he shouldn't have, quite well.\nThe story of the lady with crutches is gut-wrenching even though it didn't get much amount of runtime compared to other major characters.\nThe ending part is the highlight with the husband driven to the brink after his vendetta of getting the promotion fails and his betrayal comes to light. He also learns about his wife's unfaithfulness and thus decides to go on a murder spree brutally killing both of them. We watched the husband's body being brutally killed by a gunshot to his head by two people making it seem that it could be the work of the triad that we had seen previously.\nThe ending part reminded me a lot of Serpent's Path of Kurosawa Kiyoshi partly due to the husband's clothes.\nThe rug being pulled from beneath the audience in the ending scene where the wife suddenly sitting up makes us question the sequence. We see the guy she's cheating on her husband with, beside her and thus the previous events were a part of her dream as well.\nThe nature of the ending makes it all the more memorable and adds layers to it.\n\nThe meaning that I could derive from the film is alienation due to modernization. This reminded me of Pulse of Kurosawa Kiyoshi as it too features similar themes. The film is about a bunch of not-alone yet lonely people in a world where no one is there to listen to their woes and help them. It shows us how the new era is filled with empty shells of a bygone less prosperous yet happier era. It shows us what we are sacrificing in our pursuit of materialism.\nThe film follows several people as they try to find meaning in their lives either through within or by observing others. One is a photographer who candidly captures moments of vulnerability. Another is a teenage girl regularly making prank calls maybe to have someone to talk to even though it is just for a bit. Or it could be to instil joy into people. Or I could just be over-analysing this. A wife who is a writer now is at a loss for words due to writer's block while the husband even though a health practitioner lacks the tenderness of someone in that profession and is all the more vindictive.\nYang shows the claustrophobic nature of such a life quite well with how they suffocate beneath capitalistic ideals and how they are left without being properly understood.",

    "selftext": "At first Anora doesn’t seem like a best picture winner, but as the film progresses we learn that’s an illusion, and that there is incredible depth, drama, emotion, and empathy in the story than we might have expected. In a sense this is not unlike Annie herself- played brilliantly by Mickey Madison in what turned out to be a surprise Oscar winning role. Annie is the name she goes by in her life as a prostitute. Anora is her real name, and the true soul behind the defensive and flashy facade- more on that later.\n\nThe plot starts out like a grittier, rougher version of Pretty Woman. Ivan, an immature, wild partying son of a Russian mobster/oligarch pays Annie to be his girlfriend for the week. Not wanting the fun to end, they end up getting married in Vegas.\n\nWhen his family gets wind of it, they send their goons and fixer to solve the problem.  When they show up Ivan tries to keep them at bay and then bolts, leaving Annie behind. She attempts to leave but is thwarted by the goons and leaves them reeling with her explosively assertive personality and a few well placed kicks.\n\nEventually they tell her she will be getting an annulment, like it or not, and will get $10k for her troubles. She agrees, but insincerely. She believes in her marriage. It’s real, and Ivan hasn’t abandoned her- he’s trying to get help.\n\nFor the heart of the film she’s shoved from place to place searching for Ivan while in the custody of his father’s crew. One, a heavy named Igor, begins to stand out. We see it in small gestures of kindness to Annie, and there’s something tender about the way he looks at her.\n\nNow about that name. Annie calls herself Anora on her marriage license and introduces herself that way to Ivan’s unreceptive family.  It’s a glimpse of the core of her real self, beneath the trauma and abuse life has buried her in. And in a late night conversation, Igor says he likes Anora better. It’s a good name, he says.\n\nWhat he means is she’s good, and he likes the woman he sees hidden under all the drama.\n\nThe films final moments are a dance in powerful subtext and emotion wrapped in a scene that on the surface doesn’t appear suited for the impact it brings. It’s brilliantly done.\n\nSo yes, in the end the film is not unlike its protagonist. It looks and acts like Annie- but just under the surface it is Anora, still pining all her broken hopes and dreams- and it’s lovely.\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️/⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",

While his work often leans into self-indulgence—whether through the meta posturing of *Birdman* or the grating self-reflection of [*Bardo*](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/bardo-movie-2022/)—this film largely sidesteps that pitfall. Instead, *The Revenant* strips things down to a primal survival story, focusing on raw spectacle rather than existential musings about art and life.\n\nWhat certainly helps is Iñárritu’s collaboration with cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, whose breathtaking imagery of vast, unforgiving landscapes sets the perfect stage for this tale of endurance and revenge. Of course, the stunning visuals came at a cost—the production was notoriously grueling, with weather forcing the shoot to relocate from Canada to Argentina to find enough snow. But despite the behind-the-scenes turmoil, the film delivers on its immersive, visceral experience.\n\n[Leonardo DiCaprio](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/killers-of-the-flower-moon-movie-2023/) stars as Hugh Glass, a 19th-century frontiersman left for dead after a brutal bear attack.

    "title": "Review - Vidaamuyarchi",
    "selftext": "# Movie Review: Vidaamuyarchi\n\n*Vidaamuyarchi* is a gripping thriller that masterfully blends emotional drama, intense action, and breathtaking visuals. Directed by Magizh Thirumeni, the film takes inspiration from the 1997 American movie *Breakdown* but adds its own unique cultural and emotional layers, making it a standout in the thriller genre.\n\n# Plot and Themes:\n\nThe film begins by challenging conservative family values, immediately drawing the audience into a world where relationships and trust are put to the test. The emotional journey of the protagonists is central to the story, as they grapple with love, sacrifice, and moral dilemmas. The narrative keeps viewers on edge, constantly questioning the intentions of the characters. Is the seemingly innocent character truly trustworthy? Are the police reliable, or are they part of the corruption? These uncertainties create a sense of unease that persists throughout the film.\n\nUnlike *Breakdown*, which focuses on realism and survival, *Vidaamuyarchi* delves deeper into the emotional lives of its characters. It explores themes like loyalty, betrayal, and the lengths one is willing to go for love. The film raises thought-provoking questions: How much should one sacrifice for a spouse who is leaving? Should you stay with someone who loves you, even if your heart belongs to another? These dilemmas add a layer of complexity that resonates long after the movie ends.\n\n# Cinematography and Setting:\n\nOne of the film’s standout features is its stunning visuals. The barren, winding roads of Azerbaijan create a sense of isolation and vulnerability, perfectly complementing the thriller’s tense atmosphere. The cinematography by Om Prakash captures the desolate beauty of the landscape, evoking feelings of loneliness and helplessness. These visuals not only enhance the mood but also serve as a metaphor for the characters’ emotional states.\n\nThe choice of a foreign location is intriguing. While it adds an exotic appeal, it also modernizes the story, avoiding the logistical challenges of portraying isolation in today’s hyper-connected India. The unfamiliar setting amplifies the protagonists’ vulnerability, making their struggles feel more intense and relatable.\n\n# Performances:\n\nThe cast delivers powerful performances, with each actor bringing depth to their roles. Ajith Kumar and Trisha Krishnan shine as the protagonists, portraying their emotional turmoil with authenticity. The antagonist, played by Arjun Sarja, is particularly impressive, adding a menacing presence that elevates the film’s tension. The supporting cast, including Regina Cassandra and Arav, also deliver strong performances, making the characters feel real and multi-dimensional.\n\n# Music and Direction:\n\nAnirudh Ravichander’s music complements the film’s dramatic tone, enhancing key moments without overpowering the narrative. Magizh Thirumeni’s direction is sharp and focused, balancing the emotional and thriller elements effectively. The screenplay keeps the audience engaged, with well-timed twists and turns that maintain the suspense until the very end.\n\n# Comparison to Breakdown:\n\nWhile *Vidaamuyarchi* draws inspiration from *Breakdown*, it distinguishes itself by focusing on emotional and relational dynamics. The original film is a straightforward survival thriller, but the Indian adaptation adds layers of moral complexity and cultural nuance. This makes *Vidaamuyarchi* more than just a remake; it’s a reimagining that stands on its own merits.\n\n# Final Thoughts:\n\n*Vidaamuyarchi* is a visually stunning and emotionally charged thriller that keeps viewers hooked from start to finish. Its exploration of love, sacrifice, and trust, combined with excellent performances and breathtaking scenery, makes it a memorable cinematic experience. While its dramatic approach might not appeal to fans of gritty realism, it offers plenty of food for thought and a thrilling ride.\n\n**Rating: 8/10**  \nA must-watch for fans of emotional thrillers with a touch of exotic flair.",

    "title": "Silent Zone (2025)",
    "selftext": "A mysterious outbreak at an international airport marks the explosive beginning of Silent Zone, a post-apocalyptic action-horror film that throws viewers headfirst into a world spiraling toward collapse. Containment efforts fail almost immediately, and within days, the streets are overrun with the infected—aggressive, ravenous, and disturbingly relentless. Civilization falls swiftly, and survival becomes the only priority.\n\nIn the heart of this chaos is five-year-old Abigail (Katalin Krenn), who watches in horror as her mother (Caroline Boulton, Infinity Pool, The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent) and younger brother Lucas (Anders Olof Grundberg, Stockholm Bloodbath, Poor Things) are brutally attacked. Abigail’s fate seems sealed until she’s rescued by Cassius (Matt Devere, SAS: Red Notice, The Legend of the Gold Train), a battle-worn former soldier. In a grim twist, he is forced to shoot Abigail’s reanimated mother in front of her—an early signal that Silent Zone isn’t pulling any emotional punches.\n\nA decade later, the world is still a wasteland. The infected, now known as “ferals,” continue to roam, posing a constant threat. Abigail (now portrayed by Luca Papp, FBI: International, Dune: Prophecy) and Cassius remain on the move, locked in a gruelling journey toward “The Colony,” a rumoured safe haven aboard a flotilla of cargo ships. Along the way, they encounter Megan (Nikolett Barabas, Slingshot, A Good Day to Die Hard), a pregnant woman, and her husband David (Declan Hannigan, All the Light We Cannot See, Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris), which forces the duo to confront the emotional and moral toll of their survival-driven existence.\n\n  \n[Read the Full Review on Voices From The Balcony](https://www.voicesfromthebalcony.com/2025/03/15/silent-zone-2025-review/)",

    "title": "Review of The Electric State (2025)",
    "selftext": "[The Electric State (2025) Movie Review](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/the-electric-state-2025/)\n\nIt’s becoming increasingly unclear whether the [Marvel Cinematic Universe](https://cinephilecorner.com/lists/marvel-mcu-movies-ranked/) needs [Joe](https://cinephilecorner.com/cast-and-crew/joe-russo/) and [Anthony Russo](https://cinephilecorner.com/cast-and-crew/anthony-russo/) more, or if the Russo brothers need the MCU more. Since directing *Avengers: Endgame*, the highest-grossing film of all time at its peak, the duo has struggled to find their footing outside the franchise. Their post-MCU projects, including *Cherry* and [*The Gray Man*](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/the-gray-man-movie-2022/), failed to impress, yet [Netflix](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/back-in-action-2025/) decided to double down with them for *The Electric State*—a costly gamble that ultimately doesn’t pay off.\n\nWith a staggering $320 million budget, *The Electric State* aims for an expansive, post-apocalyptic sci-fi adventure but lands somewhere between generic and forgettable. Set in an alternate 1990s where humans and robots have waged war, the story follows [Millie Bobby Brown](https://cinephilecorner.com/cast-and-crew/millie-bobby-brown/)’s Michelle, who embarks on a cross-country journey to find her missing brother Christopher ([Woody Norman](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/cmon-cmon-2021/)). She’s joined by Cosmo, a large, sentient robot (voiced by [Alan Tudyk](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/wish-movie-2023/)), and a war-hardened veteran, Keats ([Chris Pratt](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-3-movie-2023/)). Along the way, they encounter figures like [Stanley Tucci](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/conclave-2024/)’s Ethan Skate, the CEO of SENTRE, who is revealed to be exploiting Christopher’s brainpower for sinister purposes.\n\nThe film’s cast is undeniably impressive, with [Ke Huy Quan](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/everything-everywhere-all-at-once-movie-2022/), [Giancarlo Esposito](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/megalopolis-review-2024/), [Woody Harrelson](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/fly-me-to-the-moon-2024/), [Anthony Mackie](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/captain-america-brave-new-world-2025/), [Colman Domingo](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/sing-sing-2024/), [Jenny Slate](https://cinephilecorner.com/cast-and-crew/jenny-slate/), and [Brian Cox](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/rushmore-movie-1998/) lending their talents. Millie Bobby Brown brings an emotional weight that carries parts of the movie, while Chris Pratt leans into his usual quippy, Russo-friendly persona. Stanley Tucci, though restrained, delivers an appropriately villainous performance. Yet even with a stacked ensemble, *The Electric State* feels devoid of real personality.\n\n[More Movie Reviews from Cinephile Corner](https://cinephilecorner.com/category/reviews/)",

    "selftext": "https://youtu.be/OhCTH5AiOaQ?si=s0ia6piME3Klyy3E\n\nBlack Bag - 10/10. Suave and debonair. Sleek and efficient. Enticing and tantalizing. These are just descriptors of how Black Bag is, and how Steven Soderbergh yet again shows why he’s an excellent director. He teams up with David Koepp for the second time this year (Presence just a month or so ago), and this happens to be the stronger of the collabs. Black Bag is a spy thriller that relies on the tension and atmosphere rather than action and bombastic set pieces. Its also thrown in with a dash of drama and romance (but in a underplayed manner). Its a battle of wits and trust. Soderbergh makes this in a “Out Of Sight” kind of way, where its all atmosphere and visuals to lead you through the pretty standard story. Its interesting because at one point, Soderbergh was tapped to direct a Bond movie. His idea was to take it back to the 60’s, but they passed on that proposition. Judging by this movie’s intentions, this feels like an indirect audition to show the type of Bond he would direct. There’s backstabbings, powerplays, and espionage intricacies involved. But most of all, its a thriller that is just buying into its world. The performances are very much adhering to the cool and cold spy world, and everyone does their respective parts with ease. Love the cinematography here, as it was having hints of Janusz Kaminski here and there with the glowy lights in the background. David Holmes returns to collab with Soderbergh, and he works his magic here too. I always love Holmes’ work in terms of his style, throwing in jazz tones with more modern electronic sounds. This is one of those neat thrillers where you never get bored from start to finish, and it just efficiently entertains you to the point where you forget that its a pretty normal story. Great fun, and just another addition to Soderbergh’s “cool” movies!",

    "title": "Vivarium review",
    "selftext": "How Vivarium Could Have Been a Mind-Blowing Sci-Fi Horror Classic\n\nVivarium (2019) is an unsettling, psychological sci-fi horror film that traps its characters in a seemingly endless, artificial suburbia. While many theories try to explain the film’s meaning, something about the alien’s motives and logic just doesn’t add up.\n\nAfter analyzing the movie, I’ve come up with two alternate explanations that would have made the film much more satisfying, terrifying, and mysterious—while still leaving enough questions unanswered to keep the horror intact.\n\n⸻\n\n🔍 The Biggest Problem With Vivarium\n\nMany viewers believe the aliens are trying to imitate humans in order to survive, but this doesn’t make sense.\n\n1️⃣ If the aliens are so advanced that they can create entire artificial environments, why do they need to imitate humans?\n2️⃣ If they don’t understand emotions, relationships, or human behavior, why do they force humans to raise their offspring instead of doing it themselves?\n3️⃣ If the entire suburb is a controlled, looping simulation, what’s the actual goal of the aliens?\n\nThe movie gives no clear answers, which is fine—mystery is part of the horror. But with a few tweaks, Vivarium could have been a true sci-fi horror masterpiece.\n\nHere are two ways the movie could have tied everything together while making the aliens even more terrifying.\n\n⸻\n\n1️⃣ The Mind-Blowing Space Revelation: They Were Never on Earth 🌌\n\nOne way the film could have answered key questions while keeping its eerie mystery would have been a final twist revealing that the suburban town isn’t even on Earth.\n\nHow It Would Work:\n\t•\tInstead of just endlessly falling through the layers of houses, the protagonist falls so deep that she reaches the “edge” of the environment.\n\t•\tAs she crawls forward, she sees something impossible—her legs are dangling into outer space, with Earth visible below her.\n\t•\tThis confirms that the entire suburb is a constructed alien space station, floating somewhere above Earth or deep in the cosmos.\n\nWhy This Works:\n\n✅ Explains why they can’t escape—they aren’t even on Earth anymore.\n✅ Makes the horror cosmic—instead of being trapped in a weird town, they’re prisoners in a massive alien experiment.\n✅ Still keeps the mystery intact—we never find out how they got there, but we now understand where they are.\n✅ Raises terrifying new questions—how many of these fake towns exist? Are there thousands of them orbiting Earth, each trapping different people?\n\nHow It Would End:\n\n🔥 Either she floats off into space, realizing she will never escape…\n🔥 OR she sees thousands of identical towns floating in space, proving this is part of a massive alien breeding experiment.\n\n⸻\n\n2️⃣ The XCOM-Style Psionic Alien Theory: The Suburb Was Never Real 🧠\n\nInstead of creating a physical town, the aliens could have been more like the psionic, insectoid creatures from XCOM, using telepathic abilities to manipulate human perception.\n\nHow It Would Work:\n\t•\tThe suburb doesn’t physically exist—it’s a mental illusion projected into the minds of the victims.\n\t•\tThe aliens are powerful psionic beings, trapping people in a fake reality while they are actually inside a dark hive or laboratory.\n\t•\tThe looping, repetitive nature of the suburb is a mind control technique—if you believe you can’t leave, you won’t try to escape.\n\t•\tThe “child” isn’t actually growing in a human way—it’s a parasite feeding off their emotions or brainwaves while they waste away.\n\nWhy This Works:\n\n✅ Explains the looping environment—it’s all in their heads.\n✅ Explains the alien’s intelligence gap—they aren’t trying to “be human”; they are purely instinctual parasites using mind control.\n✅ Would create amazing horror visuals—imagine if the illusion broke, and we saw the protagonist trapped inside an alien nest, with thousands of other victims all hooked into the same mental projection.\n\nHow It Would End:\n\n🔥 The protagonist finally sees through the illusion, but it’s too late—the aliens simply reset her mind and start the cycle again.\n🔥 OR she wakes up in the real world, only to realize she’s inside a massive alien hive with no way out.\n\n⸻\n\n🔺 The Alien Design: Why They Should Have Been More Animalistic\n\nOne of the creepiest details in Vivarium is when the alien child escapes on all fours. This suggests that their true form isn’t humanoid—it’s something far more disturbing.\n\nWhat If the Aliens Looked Like XCOM’s Chryssalids?\n\t•\tInstead of being weird-looking humans, they could have been large, insectoid creatures with elongated limbs and unnatural movement.\n\t•\tThey wouldn’t be intelligent in a human way—they would be hyper-intelligent hunters, controlling reality itself.\n\t•\tThe “humanoid” child could have been just a temporary larval form, eventually transforming into its real monstrous self.\n\nWhy This Would Have Made the Movie Scarier:\n\n🔥 The reveal would have been shocking—instead of an alien that just looks weird, we’d realize we’ve been dealing with something much worse the whole time.\n🔥 The horror would shift from psychological dread to physical terror—the moment it transforms, the human characters would realize they were never meant to survive.\n🔥 It explains why the child moves strangely, eats weirdly, and lacks real emotions—it was never meant to understand humans, just use them.\n\n⸻\n\nFinal Thoughts: How Vivarium Could Have Been a Masterpiece\n\nThe original movie sets up great horror elements but never fully explores them.\n\nIf they had gone all-in on one of these two ideas, it could have been:\n🔹 A mind-bending cosmic horror (if they were in space).\n🔹 A psychological sci-fi nightmare (if it was all a psionic illusion).\n\nInstead, the film leaves too many questions unanswered, making the aliens feel less like a terrifying force and more like a weird experiment that doesn’t make sense.\n\n⸻\n\nWhat Do You Think?\n\n💭 Would my alternate endings have made the movie scarier?\n💭 Do you think the aliens were running a broken system, or do you think they were parasites using humans as hosts?\n💭 Which is more terrifying—being trapped in space or being stuck in a psychic illusion?\n\nLet’s discuss! 🚀👽",

      "One interesting thing that I only learned because of this is that the inflated budgets for Netflix movies are really just because of the difference from box office accounting. The streaming release has no quantifiable revenue, so there can't be royalties. All the actors, directors, etc. have inflated front end checks to compensate for the fact that they will never see another dime after release. So when we see that a Marvel movie cost $300m for production, what we never see is how much it has payed out in royalties since release which would make that much higher. I found it interesting anyway."

Both involve similar minded dilemmas for the main character, where here the character is facing financial strains as his main problem, Dragon’s strains come from lying and circumventing the system. Manikandan started off his acting career as a lead hero in spectacular fashion. He had Aelay and Jai Bhim in 2021, then Good Night in 2023, and then Lover in 2024. All very solid films overall. Here, we get a new age V Sekhar/Visu film in Kudumbasthan. Its a comedy drama about the complications that happen within middle class life. How money, ego, and comparisons sort of ruin the very essence as to why we live. Kudumbasthan is a nice and well made movie, spinning the family melodrama techniques popularized and perfected by the said directors above, but providing a modern spin on it with modern directing, editing, and story telling. The performances are nice, and the music is splendid, but my one negative about the film was the somewhat silly nature at points of the film. Not that its a huge drawback, but it did feel like it took away from some of the scenes at times. Otherwise, this is another solid addition to Manikandan’s young career, and one of the better films so far in tamil cinema in 2025!",

The essence of the movie lies in the visuals and it was also visually captivating, with brilliant frames and cinematography which is impactful and mentally dominating by capturing the beauty of nature and how it is deeply connected and rooted with us. It also discusses the theme of nature and human and throughout the movie one feels that nature was also part of the movie. Setting of the movie, which is a monastery in the middle of lake also have importance and it will remember forever in our mind after watching the movie. Performance was also worth mentioning one, brilliant but the beauty of the movie lies in frames in which cinematography deserves appreciation for carrying out such magical frames.\n\nFollow me on Letterboxd : [https://boxd.it/67lJb](https://boxd.it/67lJb)",

He needs somewhere he can do that in peace, and rather than rent some office space, he buys a house to do it in, and since the film is called Amityville AI you can guess what house it is. There’s no mention of the DeFeo murders, but we are told that the serial killer known as The Babylon Butcher claimed some lives here after escaping from the local mental institution. VIC lives on his laptop and the two have conversations, during one of which VIC mentions he’s feeling stressed out, and it isn’t a virus. Could it be demonic possession?

    "title": "The Electric State (2025) - Netflix new Blockbuster",
    "selftext": "Based on Simon Stålenhag’s 2018 graphic novel The Electric State, which followed a young girl’s journey of coping with loss in a dystopian future where a war between robots and humans had lasting consequences, this $320 million adaptation from Marvel veterans Anthony and Joe Russo largely abandons the book’s thought-provoking themes of human-technology interaction in favor of large-scale blockbuster spectacle. The novel was praised for its quiet, introspective nature—qualities that are entirely absent here. Instead, The Electric State applies the MCU filmmaking style to what is essentially a ’90s adventure movie plot, incorporating elements of Fallout and Spy Kids 3.\n\nThe spectacle is certainly there. The visual effects and robot designs feel impressively tactile, and the film delivers the kind of large-scale world-building expected from a production of this size. If given full attention—without the distraction of a phone—it offers a solid level of immersion. Alan Silvestri’s score enhances the film’s adventurous feel, striking a fine balance between nostalgic and modern sounds, much like his work on Ready Player One. The film’s emotional core remains intact, with some third-act moments between the central siblings delivering genuine impact. Even some of the robots—particularly the less humanoid ones—manage to evoke emotion, while others lean into outright unsettling designs.\n\nRead my full review at: https://reviewsonreels.ca/2025/03/13/the-electric-state/",

I loved the song How Far I'll Go - I was shocked 2025 was the first time I had ever heard this song, so I was excited to see Moana 2, and unfortunately it reminded me of watching Sony's Madame Web (2024).\n\nThe movie's story comes off as a word cloud exercise. Things happens and you hope they'll explain it later with little to now explanation. Characters are introduces but never fleshed out including main characters like Moana's crew who are all skin deep. It was like David Ayer's Suicide Squad where the movie just rehashes a characters gimmick again. I'm not even sure to what effect. Loto is my favorite character from this movie but she never grows beyond being the boat's tinkerer. \n\nIt's also shocking how long Disney keeps Maui and Moana apart. Not to mention all of Maui's scenes prior to their reunion feel like they were supposed to be taking place off world or on another plane. \n\n1 out of 5 \n\nCheck out the full review of Moana 2 at The Big Comic Page - a blog site I write reviews of comics and movies: [https://bigcomicpage.com/2025/03/13/movie-review-moana-2-2024/](https://bigcomicpage.com/2025/03/13/movie-review-moana-2-2024/)",

It's a masterpiece of action cinema and an impressively immersive post-apocalyptic adventure that squeezes limitless imagination and filmmaking craft into every available frame.

    "title": "Movie Review - The Rule Of Jenny Pen",
    "selftext": "https://youtube.com/shorts/gxtwsmVMMLA?si=Yqsb2boAlFmAbus3\n\nThe Rule Of Jenny Pen - 8/10. Glad that I decided to watch this after I was done work. Saw this movie was playing at Scotiabank Theater (I think its the only theater playing it too), and I had time to kill, so I gave this a shot. I went into this with no expectations or knowledge of what it might be about, and I came out thinking this was solid! The Rule Of Jenny Pen is an interesting and surprisingly effective psychological horror drama. And quite surprisingly, it feels very real too. Set in a senior home, it sets the stage for a grounded horror movie that sadly can happen to anyone. Aging is a scary thing, and an aging mind is scary too in terms of its effects on the person. And this film also shows that even at an older age, some people are just downright sociopathic with no sense of normalcy. In the case of this movie, we see a person who is slowly becoming a shell of himself, and another who is gradually entering more depths of evil. John Lithgow is such a great villain here, and a vile and sadistic one at that. Every time he appears on screen, you get a surge of rage due to his attitude and actions. He creates a great horror villain, one that creates a dangerous power dynamic due to the villain having more physical ability in comparison to the rest of the residents. Geoffrey Rush does an equally great job as a person that goes from an arrogant resident, to becoming one that must understand that he has to overcome his declining health in order to overcome this psychologically horrific ordeal. In a possibly unintentional way, this also a commentary on the negligence that could happen in a senior home. I know its a movie: but where the hell are all workers at night? We see this man taking advantage of the negligence and tormenting his fellow residents, and there’s not one worker to be seen to check on the hallways or security cameras. It makes for a satisfying ending here (though, I felt this movie had 4 different endings by the end). Great surprise of a film, and for those of you seeking a smaller film that might catch you by surprise, then catch this one!",

    "selftext": "Two years before defining the slasher genre with Halloween, John Carpenter arguably delivered an even tighter, more well-rounded film with Assault on Precinct 13—and on an even smaller budget. His status as a master of horror is undeniable, but beyond that, he excels at doing more with less. Indie filmmakers could learn a lot from both this and Halloween.\n\nMade for just $100,000 and shot in 20 days, the film never feels cheap. Carpenter’s use of widescreen cinematography (2.35:1 Panavision), long takes, and precise shot composition creates an immersive experience far beyond its budget. The cast and crew were mostly friends, and he cut, composed, and edited the now-iconic synth score himself—an approach he’d revisit in Halloween. He also smartly uses sound, with silenced gunfire adding to the eerie atmosphere while serving its narrative purpose, enhancing the film’s sense of scale and tension.\n\nRead my full review at: https://reviewsonreels.ca/2025/03/13/assault-on-precinct-13/\n\nMy Favorite Scene: The ice cream truck scene.

The [2019 film](https://cinephilecorner.com/lists/best-movies-2019-ranked/) was a global phenomenon, breaking language barriers at the Academy Awards and cementing Bong as one of the most exciting directors of his generation. With *Mickey 17*, his first film since that historic win, he dives headfirst into sci-fi, adapting Edward Ashton’s 2022 novel *Mickey7* with an all-star cast that includes [Robert Pattinson](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/the-batman-movie-2022/), [Naomi Ackie](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/blink-twice-movie-review-2024/), [Steven Yeun](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/nope-movie-2022/), [Mark Ruffalo](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/poor-things-movie-2023/), and [Toni Collette](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/juror-2-movie-review-2024/).\n\n*Mickey 17* follows Mickey Barnes (Pattinson), an “Expendable” worker who is repeatedly cloned every time he dies while serving on a deep-space colonization mission. In this near-future, Earth is becoming uninhabitable, and the socioeconomic divide has grown insurmountable. Desperate to escape a violent loan shark, Mickey and Timo (Yeun) sign up for a dangerous space expedition to Niflheim, where Mickey assumes the role of an Expendable—dying over and over again in the name of scientific progress while retaining most of his memories.\n\nAboard the spaceship are a collection of eccentric figures, including Mickey’s love interest Nasha Barridge (Ackie), power-hungry politician Kenneth Marshall (Ruffalo), and his domineering wife Ylfa (Collette), who are hard to separate from their obvious real-world political inspirations—including current [United States President Donald Trump](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/the-apprentice-movie-review-2024/). Much like [*Snowpiercer*](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/snowpiercer-2013/) and *Okja*, *Mickey 17* juggles big ideas about class division, environmental collapse, and capitalist exploitation. But unlike *Parasite*—or even [*Memories of Murder*](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/memories-of-murder-2003/)—the storytelling lacks focus.\n\n[Read More Movie Reviews from Cinephile Corner](https://cinephilecorner.com/category/reviews/)",

So first off Robert Pattinson kills it definitely one or if not the best performance from him. Although I didn't like the humor in this movie Robert as Mickey is hilarious. Next is the world setting of Niflheim It is beautifully shot and looks fantastic the ship design is original and looks great. This movie is definitely bizarre and I mean in the best way possible. The movie reminds me of films like Total Recall, Fifth Element, Starship Troopers, and Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy which those movies are amazing so is this film good enough to be worthy of being a classic, NO! Okay it's not that bad but it's disappointing and wastes it's potential. The movie does some things really well but doesn't quite stick the landing.!<\n\n>!I wish the movie took a different path but the movie took a boring path which if you don't know is the aliens are the good guys all along. Yep like we totally haven't seen that premise reused a hundred times. The movie had a thousand cool ideas and instead they focused on a story that is uninspired. Okay the alien plot isn't terrible but if it at least had an interesting finale then I could excuse it but the finale is boring and slow like the rest of the movie. All of the characters besides Mickey were boring especially Mark Ruffalo who comes off as annoying and I know his character is supposed to be that way but I'm sorry his character just couldn't click for me. However I know a lot of people are going to like this movie so go see it but I'm sorry this movie is a disappointing and not terrible movie a bit of a forgettable one. This was my most anticipated movie and ended up not really making it.!<\n\n>!6/10 Didn't really care for it by the time I was out of the theatre.!<>!​!<",

    "selftext": "[Full Review of Snowpiercer (2013)](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/snowpiercer-2013/)\n\nIt’s taken me multiple viewings to fully warm up to *Snowpiercer* (no pun intended). [Bong Joon-ho](https://cinephilecorner.com/cast-and-crew/bong-joon-ho/)’s first primarily English-language [film](https://cinephilecorner.com/category/reviews/) is both brilliantly executed as a sci-fi thriller—boasting stunning set pieces and an inspired apocalyptic bullet train setting—and burdened by an overly on-the-nose allegory about class warfare that at times dulls its impact.\n\nSet in a post-apocalyptic future where a failed climate experiment has frozen the planet, humanity’s last survivors live aboard the Snowpiercer, a perpetual-motion train where a strict social hierarchy has formed. The wealthy elite live lavishly at the front, while the impoverished masses are crammed into the squalid tail section, surviving on gelatinous protein bars. Among the ruling class is Wilford ([Ed Harris](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/love-lies-bleeding-movie-2024/)), the mysterious engineer behind the train’s never-ending journey, and Minister Mason ([Tilda Swinton](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/moonrise-kingdom-movie-2012/)), his grotesquely cartoonish enforcer. In the tail section, Curtis ([Chris Evans](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/ghosted-movie-2023/)) leads a violent rebellion, assisted by Edgar ([Jamie Bell](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/all-of-us-strangers-movie-2023/)), Tanya ([Octavia Spencer](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/spirited-movie-2022/)), and the group’s elderly spiritual leader, Gilliam ([John Hurt](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/the-elephant-man-movie-1980/)). Their goal: seize control of the train, with the help of Namgoong Minsoo ([Song Kang-ho](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/broker-movie-2022/)), a drug-addicted security expert who can unlock the train’s barriers.\n\nBong Joon-ho is a master of visual storytelling, and *Snowpiercer* works best in high-energy moments where social classes collide in gorgeously choreographed action sequences. The film’s set design is remarkable, with each train car revealing a new and often grotesquely exaggerated piece of this dystopian world. The fight scenes—particularly the brutal nighttime brawl in the narrow train corridor—are some of Bong’s best. And Tilda Swinton, fully embracing her bizarre, twitchy role, is a true highlight, giving one of the most entertaining performances in the film and in her career.\n\n[More Movie Reviews from Cinephile Corner](https://cinephilecorner.com/category/reviews/)",

    "title": "Movie Review - Novocaine",
    "selftext": "https://youtube.com/shorts/jwqxanNHmpM?si=Atk5XXOF1-NTZqJU\n\nNovocaine - 10/10. A purely fun, charming, and entertaining film! This might be the first body horror/romcom/action comedy film (technically not a horror movie, but when you watch this, you’ll understand what I mean). Novocaine might remind of the Indian film “The Man Who Feels No Pain,” in terms of its protagonist’s condition. But, this movie is just a fun romp, seeing an everyday guy becoming an almost inadvertent John Wick type because of said condition. These types of concept films used to come very often, but its nice to see that these types of movies are still being made. Jack Quaid is great here, making you believe he’s just an ordinary person trying to break his way to get to the point of saving the girl of his dreams. He does the action scenes so well here that you really buy into the character not knowing how to attack or fight, but rather, has an advantage due to not being able to be subdued by the villains due to his non pain ways. His chemistry with Amber Midthunder is great too, as you kinda think this is a romcom at points as well. The biggest plus about this film is the way they have orchestrated the story and the way the character is able to go forward with his mission. The action is choreographed and directed nicely, giving it an awkwardness that matches the main character. The pacing is great, with the film barely feeling drawn out or boring at any point. And good twist too (I didn’t catch on to it, but maybe on rewatches I might realize how obvious it is). Great film, super entertaining, and you can’t help but be entertained from start to finish!",

    "selftext": "Despite varying levels of success, the first quarter of 2025 has been notable for delivering some truly creative (and often bizarre) genre mashups. Novocaine joins Heart Eyes, Companion (which also featured Jack Quaid), and Love Hurts in a string of films that attempt to blend romance with unexpected twists. While most of these experiments haven’t exactly resulted in great films, it’s at least refreshing to see Hollywood trying something new with traditionally formulaic genres. This time, we get a romance spliced into a Taken-style action thriller, featuring a protagonist who literally cannot feel pain.\n\nJack Quaid stars as Nathan Caine, a bank executive with congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP), whose romance with his depressed coworker Sherry (Amber Midthunder) is cut short when she’s kidnapped the morning after their first date. With no combat training and no real toughness beyond his inability to register injuries, Nathan embarks on a dangerous rescue mission, turning what would normally be a major disadvantage into his greatest asset.\n\nNovocaine is a film that wins you over with its commitment to pushing its ridiculous premise to the limit. By fully embracing its central concept and delivering a mix of well-staged action and darkly funny, wince-inducing moments, it proves that there’s still room for creative, absurd fun in the action-comedy genre.\n\nRead my full review at: https://reviewsonreels.ca/2025/03/10/novocaine/",

    "title": "DEATH OF A UNICORN Film Review - Weirdness for the Masses",
    "selftext": "The most popular screening at SXSW...\n\nAlways appreciate when folks read the review on the site, but I've done my best to copy it down below as well. \n\n[Read the full review here](https://pointsofreviews.com/death-of-a-unicorn-film-review/)\n\n# DEATH OF A UNICORN Film Review - What Happens When You Take \"Weird\" to the Mainstream\n\n---\n\n### What is *Death of a Unicorn* About?\n\nBlending satire, creature horror, and comedy, *Death of a Unicorn* follows Elliot and Ridley Kintner (**Paul Rudd** and **Jenna Ortega**), a father and daughter who find themselves at an exclusive wilderness retreat hosted by the ultra-wealthy Leopold family. On their way, they hit a unicorn with their car – only to discover its horn possesses miraculous healing properties. As the Leopolds (**Richard E. Grant, Will Poulter, Téa Leoni**) seize the opportunity to capitalize on this newfound pharmaceutical goldmine, chaos ensues when the unicorn’s vengeful parents come seeking retribution. Essentially, the film views itself as a satirical takedown of greed, power, and entitlement, with some \"monsters\" thrown in for good measure.\n\nPremiering at the [**2025 SXSW Film & TV Festival**](https://www.sxsw.com/festivals/film/), *Death of a Unicorn* was the festival’s biggest draw, with over 1,000 people lining up for blocks around The Paramount Theatre. And look – the film delivered what the audience wanted. The theatre was filled with near-constant laughter and even two raucous rounds of cheers for a pair of particularly memorable deaths (no more spoilers than that).\n\nBut while it is certainly a fun ride, it’s also far from groundbreaking.\n\n---\n\n### A Wild Concept, but a Safe Execution\n\nAt its core, *Death of a Unicorn* takes a bizarre, high-concept premise and runs it through a mainstream filter. It has moments of gore and absurdity, but it never truly leans into its weirdness in a way that would push boundaries. Instead, the film plays within familiar tropes: the obscenely rich exploiting everything they can for more power, the mistreatment of servants, the spoiled and drunken heir, and a father-daughter duo caught in the middle of the madness. While it’s a solid satirical setup, it doesn’t go much deeper than what we’ve seen time and time again (unicorns aside).\n\n---\n\n### The Inspiration behind *Death of a Unicorn*\n\nDirector **Alex Scharfman** drew from a mix of inspirations, blending medieval unicorn mythology with a modern critique of corporate greed. Unicorns have long symbolized purity and healing, and historically, their horns were thought to counteract poison – an idea that naturally dovetailed into a pharmaceutical satire. In Scharfman's words, “Humans would invariably commodify the purity and curative properties of unicorns—after killing them first.”\n\nThe **Leopold family** is a thinly veiled satire of real-world pharmaceutical dynasties (*think the Sackler family*). Scharfman leans into the idea of the ultra-wealthy viewing themselves as benevolent forces while, in reality, using their influence for personal gain. The film’s absurdity amplifies their detachment from morality, portraying them as self-absorbed figures who see a magical, otherworldly creature as another way to increase profits.\n\n---\n\n### A Polished but Unadventurous Visual Approach\n\nVisually, *Death of a Unicorn* is clean and effective but not particularly daring. **Larry Fong’s** cinematography (best known for *300* and *Kong: Skull Island*) is technically flawless, but it doesn’t take many risks. The film is sharply shot, but there is no experimentation to elevate it beyond standard genre work.\n\nThe production design, helmed by **Amy Williams**, is more layered. The Leopolds’ wilderness retreat is meticulously detailed, but it never feels truly “lived in.” Much like the family that owns it, the mansion is grand but hollow – a pretty deliberate choice that supports the film’s themes of excess and detachment.\n\n---\n\n### The Unicorn Design in *Death of a Unicorn*\n\nOne of the film’s biggest highlights is its creature design. Instead of the pastel, fairytale unicorns of popular culture, these unicorns feel ancient, almost prehistoric, with rhino-like bulk, feline agility, and razor-sharp talons. The film uses a mix of practical puppetry and digital effects, with **Zoic Studios, Filmefex, and Wētā Workshop** collaborating to bring the creatures to life. While undeniably impressive, the unicorns never feel entirely groundbreaking – more *well-executed* than *revolutionary*.\n\n---\n\n### The Relationship Between Paul Rudd's and Jenna Ortega's Characters\n\nDespite its well-crafted world, *Death of a Unicorn* lacks an emotional centre. The film wants us to invest in Elliot and Ridley’s father-daughter relationship, but their bond feels underwritten. We’re told about their history – Elliot is a recently widowed lawyer, and Ridley is struggling to connect with him – but the emotional beats get lost in the chaos of elites and unicorns. The film doesn’t give us enough moments to truly *feel* their relationship beyond the surface-level setup.\n\n---\n\n### Will Poulter and the Comedy of *Death of a Unicorn*\n\nWhile much of the humour comes from satirical exaggeration and physical gags, the standout is **Will Poulter** as Shepard Leopold. Playing the spoiled, oblivious heir to the Leopold fortune, Poulter takes a stock character and elevates him with near-perfect delivery. His self-absorbed antics – snorting ground unicorn horn or insisting on using his custom-made compound bow, for example – did, admittedly, have me laughing out loud on several occasions.\n\nElsewhere, **Paul Rudd** delivers exactly what you’d expect – his signature charm – but nothing about the role pushes him beyond what we’ve seen before. **Jenna Ortega** is strong as Ridley, but the script doesn’t give her much to work with emotionally. The rest of the Leopolds are perfectly entertaining, but none are memorable beyond their one-note, archetypal roles.\n\n---\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\nAt the end of the day, *Death of a Unicorn* is an entertaining and accessible dark comedy. It’s the kind of film that will appeal to those looking for something *weird* without pushing them too far outside their comfort zone.\n\nAs I left the theatre, I overheard someone say it was “the craziest movie they’d ever seen.” Considering films like *Dead Lover* were playing at the same festival, I couldn't help but chuckle, but it speaks to *Death of a Unicorn’s* role as the “weird” movie for people who don’t actually watch weird movies.\n\nStill, it’s another **solid A24 entry –** not close to their most daring, but certainly one that will find an audience, much like it did at its world premiere.\n\n---\n\n**Read More:**\n\n- [SXSW](https://pointsofreviews.com/category/film-festivals/sxsw//)\n- [Interviews](https://pointsofreviews.com/category/film-interviews/)\n- [Film Reviews](https://pointsofreviews.com/category/film-reviews/)\n",

    "selftext": "Another good thriller movie from Mollywood. The way the plot was written and presented was so good and alternate history storytelling method, Kathodu Kathoram movie set recreation and Rekha's character presentation and proper use of flashbacks are so good and it strengthen and makes the screenplay look so unique. Mammootty 's AI Generated face was so good and they also deserve appreciation for the recreation of Kathodu Kathoram film shooting set and the proper use of alterative history. But there are some problems in this movie. This movie fails to make an engaging investigation and I didn't felt any attachment towards Asif's character. Rekha's characterization was good and Anaswara did a great job but this movie would have been greater if they tried to make Asif's character more interesting. I felt nothing about Asif's character while watching the movie and it creates a feeling that something is missing. It is not Asif's problem because he was perfect casting for this role and I can't even imagine another person for this role. The problem was that character is not defined well and there's no emotional attachment towards that character and because of that reason I felt some lag during watching the movie. But all these problems are, like I have said, is covered by proper use of other plot keys such as Rekha's characterization (Anaswara Rajan), alterative history and Kathodu Kathoram setting recreation (AI Generated Bharathan was so good, I don't know if it was AI Generated but it was good). Unexpected antagonist was so good in this movie and it is another bonus point. There's a background score while Antagonist twist revealing flashback story which was so good. Rekha's characterization was so good and it had an important role in making the climax of the story more impactful but overall I felt nothing. Overall movie was so great because of the proper use of screenplay but it would have been better if they tried to make an emotional attachment towards Asif's character. I write three and half because of alternate history and screenplay and it would have been just three if screenplay was average one.\n\nFollow me on Letterboxd for more reviews : [https://boxd.it/67lJb](https://boxd.it/67lJb)",

    "selftext": "https://youtu.be/-GacvM7DarQ?si=qjDLsUkvEldwODYl\n\nMickey 17 - 7/10. This is gonna be another film which I liked, but, didn’t like it as much as everyone else did. Mickey 17 has a lot going on and some good things going for it. You have a director that has been given carte blanche ability here, and its quite nice to see in terms of seeing a director seeing their vision through. You have Robert Pattinson having a ball here, playing these different personalities and just having fun while doing so. You get a sense this was a movie that had to be carried by a good performer, and the good thing is Pattinson takes the mantle and runs with it. The world and the sociopolitical commentary here is nice too. There’s tons of subjects being touched upon (being an expendable person in the workforce, the ethics of cloning and their rights, the idea of colonization in a foreign area, etc). Its commendable that a director decided to focus on these things within a big budget sci-fi film, when he could’ve easily played things safe. But, I feel like we get a ton of things that just feel mashed together and being brought forward in a diluted and tonally changing film. The tone is surprisingly goofy at times, and though there are serious things being hinted at and talked about, I feel the over the top tone kinda took me out of the film. Its satire, but I just felt the sci-fi nature of the story clashed with the satire at moments. Overall, Mickey 17 is one of those films that will be liked by the majority, but will cause a deviation in how much one person liked it in comparison to the other. I respect films like this though! They dare to push the envelope on the traditional big budget film, and I sincerely hope it does well because that way, it will give the green light to studios to allow directors to explore more themes and ideas in their big movies (rather than just sticking to generic commentary and tropes).",

    "selftext": "\nHow Vivarium Could Have Been a Mind-Blowing Sci-Fi Horror Classic\n\nVivarium (2019) is an unsettling psychological sci-fi horror film that explores themes of confinement, control, and the eerie nature of artificial environments. While the film succeeds in creating an atmosphere of unease, certain elements leave more questions than answers.\n\nAfter analyzing the story and its themes, I’ve come up with two alternate directions that could have made the film even more terrifying, thought-provoking, and satisfying—while still leaving enough mystery to keep audiences engaged.\n\n⸻\n\n🔍 The Biggest Question: What Was Really Happening?\n\nMany viewers have theories about the deeper meaning behind the film’s world and its inhabitants, but certain aspects don’t seem to fully align.\n\n1️⃣ If an advanced force can create entire artificial environments, why does it rely on imitating human behavior?\n2️⃣ Why does the setting operate in such a repetitive, structured way, and what purpose does that serve?\n3️⃣ If control is a major theme, then what is the ultimate goal of those behind it?\n\nThe movie leaves these ideas open-ended, which adds to the mystery, but there were ways the film could have deepened the horror while also providing a more satisfying resolution.\n\nHere are two alternate interpretations that would have tied everything together in a more chilling way.\n\n⸻\n\n1️⃣ A Mind-Blowing Cosmic Horror Twist 🌌\n\nOne way the film could have provided a deeper revelation without removing the mystery would be to suggest that the setting itself is not what it appears to be.\n\nHow It Could Have Worked:\n\t•\tAs the story progresses, the protagonist gradually uncovers evidence that reality itself is not grounded in what they assumed.\n\t•\tA discovery reveals that this entire environment is part of something much larger and far beyond human comprehension.\n\t•\tThe true nature of their situation reframes the entire experience, raising disturbing new questions about who—or what—is really in control.\n\nWhy This Would Have Worked:\n\n✅ Explains why escape is impossible—because the setting itself is not of human origin.\n✅ Shifts the horror from psychological to cosmic—expanding the scope of the nightmare.\n✅ Keeps the mystery intact—we don’t need all the answers, but we need to understand the scale of what’s happening.\n✅ Adds a grander sense of existential terror—what if this isn’t an isolated event, but part of something much bigger?\n\nHow It Would End:\n\n🔥 The protagonist finally sees the full scope of their reality, but it’s something far beyond their understanding…\n🔥 OR they glimpse something they were never meant to see, confirming the horrifying truth behind their existence.\n\n⸻\n\n2️⃣ The Reality-Bending Psychological Nightmare 🧠\n\nInstead of being a physical trap, what if the entire experience was an illusion created by an external force?\n\nHow It Could Have Worked:\n\t•\tThe world around them isn’t actually real—it’s a projection, designed to keep them contained.\n\t•\tThe repeating patterns and structure are not physical barriers, but mental ones.\n\t•\tThe entire scenario is orchestrated by something with deep control over perception, shaping reality to its will.\n\nWhy This Would Have Worked:\n\n✅ Explains why everything feels slightly “off”—because it’s artificially imposed on their minds.\n✅ Reinforces the theme of control—if an external force can manipulate reality itself, then even thoughts of escape might be illusions.\n✅ Would create stunning horror visuals—imagine the moment when the illusion breaks, revealing what was really happening all along.\n\nHow It Would End:\n\n🔥 The protagonist finally sees through the illusion—but realizes they were never truly free to begin with.\n🔥 OR they wake up in the real world, only to find that their nightmare is far from over.\n\n⸻\n\n🔺 The Inhabitants: Why They Should Have Been More Animalistic\n\nOne of the eeriest elements of Vivarium is how certain characters behave in unnatural ways. But what if they weren’t just mimicking humans—what if their true nature was something entirely different?\n\nHow It Could Have Worked:\n\t•\tInstead of appearing mostly human, these beings could have moved and acted more like primal hunters, revealing that they are not intelligent in the way we understand.\n\t•\tThey wouldn’t need human emotions or logic—because they were never meant to interact with humans in the first place.\n\t•\tTheir form could have been something truly alien, with movements that hinted at a far more disturbing nature beneath the surface.\n\nWhy This Would Have Made the Movie Scarier:\n\n🔥 Instead of just feeling “off”, they would feel like something that shouldn’t exist in our world at all.\n🔥 Their actions would have felt predatory, not just uncanny, making them genuinely terrifying.\n🔥 It explains why they struggle to understand human behavior—because they were never supposed to.\n\n⸻\n\nFinal Thoughts: How Vivarium Could Have Been a Sci-Fi Horror Masterpiece\n\nThe original film sets up great horror concepts, but it never fully explores them.\n\nIf they had gone deeper into one of these two alternate ideas, the movie could have been:\n🔹 A cosmic horror film about the terrifying scale of the unknown.\n🔹 A psychological nightmare about the fragility of perception and control.\n\nInstead, it leaves too many questions unanswered in a way that makes the “mystery” feel incomplete rather than haunting.\n\n⸻\n\nWhat Do You Think?\n\n💭 Would these alternate interpretations have made the film even scarier?\n💭 Do you think the story was meant to remain open-ended, or did it need more answers?\n💭 Which is more terrifying—realizing you’re trapped in an artificial world, or discovering that your entire reality is just an illusion?\n\nLet’s discuss! 🚀👽\n",

Interesting that this movie had been delayed for quite some time (initially premiering at TIFF 2023). Also: love that its shot at the Four Seasons and around Toronto in general! This really is a vehicle to show the acting prowess of Amanda Seyfried! And she’s such a good performer! Its amazing to see how she has transformed her acting skills over the years. She really embodies the character here, playing a character who is slowly being haunted and psychologically tormented by her past. This seeps into her work, which has a direct correlation to the haunted past she has. For Seyfried, this is a layered and interesting role, and she really is the heart of the film. The side plot here is an effective one too, and kind of works in parallel to the ordeal the main character is going through. In terms of Egoyan and Seyfriend collaborating again, I would say that their previous collab (Chloe) was much more enticing and dramatic in terms of its story. But, I would say that Seven Veils is a much more controlled and packaged film in comparison to Chloe. Good film powered by a good performance from Seyfried!",

Today, we are delving into the bizarre world of cinema to discuss the infamous 1974 film \"Zardoz.\" This science fiction cult classic has garnered a reputation for being one of the most absurd and outlandish movies ever made. Join us as we explore the strange and surreal world of \"Zardoz\" and uncover why this film has left audiences scratching their heads for decades.\nDirected by John Boorman, \"Zardoz\" takes place in a dystopian future where society is divided into two distinct classes: the immortal Eternals who live in a utopian paradise, and the Brutals who live in squalor and servitude. The film follows a barbarian named Zed, played by Sean Connery in one of his most bizarre roles, as he is sent on a mission to infiltrate the Eternals' society and uncover its secrets.\nOne of the central themes of \"Zardoz\" is the exploration of class division and the consequences of immortality. The Eternals, who have achieved immortality through advanced technology, have become bored and stagnant, while the Brutals struggle to survive in a harsh and unforgiving world. The film raises questions about the nature of existence and the pursuit of eternal life, as well as the impact of social inequality on society as a whole.\nFrom the opening shot of a giant floating stone head spewing guns and ammunition, \"Zardoz\" immediately establishes itself as a visually striking and surreal experience. The costumes and set designs are a bizarre mix of futuristic and primitive elements, creating a disorienting and otherworldly aesthetic. The film is filled with strange and unsettling imagery, from the ritualistic worship of the stone head to the psychedelic visions experienced by the characters.\nOne of the most memorable aspects of \"Zardoz\" is its eccentric and larger-than-life characters. Sean Connery's portrayal of Zed is a fascinating mix of barbarian warrior and existential philosopher, as he grapples with the meaning of his existence and his place in the world. The Eternals are portrayed as aloof and detached beings, disconnected from the realities of life and death. Together, these characters create a bizarre and compelling dynamic that keeps viewers engaged throughout the film.\nDespite its absurdity, \"Zardoz\" contains several thought-provoking messages and themes that resonate with audiences. The film explores the limits of human knowledge and the hubris of attempting to transcend mortality, as well as the consequences of unchecked power and privilege. By presenting these ideas in a strange and surreal manner, \"Zardoz\" challenges viewers to think critically about the world around them and the choices they make.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/UN2GFQYBxIw?si=EBCPTJWugYFWeYSD",

    "selftext": "I have decided to watch this movie just because of one name, the name which I most trust as a director, and it was Bong joon ho. One of his movie, Memories of Murder is one of my favorite movie and it was the reason I have decided to watch this. The main ability I have observed in him was his ability to make a the movie one of the best in which the genre which he dealt with. His ability to make movies with almost every genre is also makes him different from others and it makes him one of the best directors in the contemporary film era and this movie can be included one among them. One can find a kind of parasite style in case of its screenplay, characters and the way comedy scenes are presented. Bong Joon ho after taken his previous work , which was parasite's screenplay and made some changes and presented it as Science fiction movie, that's what I felt while watching the movie. But it was fun and enjoyable for me most of the time, comedy scenes in this movie worked well and it makes the movie unique and screenplay as flowing according to the motion. Performance were so cool, especially that of Robert Pattinson and Mark Ruffalo (Our hulk). Some of Ruffalo's mannerisms and expressions created a laughing riot while watching the movie and Robert Pattinson, What a Performance! He had already proved that he is a good actor through movies such as Batman and Lighthouse and through this movie he also proved that he can make a lot of things and miracles if he got many more roles. Creating a science fiction comedy movie is a difficult thing because it is difficult to mix with these genre. Sci-fi and comedy always repel for most of us because most of our sci-fi movie got a serious mode, especially apocalyptic sci-fi movies, movies are really few in which science fiction is following a comedy track. Even though some will say some of the movies of marvel, it is not always a comedy track (Marvel is comedy now, hope they will cook something unique but there's no hope). But for Bong Joon ho, it was like drinking a cup of tea and he again proved that he is a master of making this kind of movies. Speciality of his movies are most of his movies look like simple, but it has multiple layers. His movie talks many things and have many layers. Movies such as Snowpiercer and Parasite are some of the best example and this movie also can be included in that genre. This Dark Comedy movie talks about many things such as Human Invention, Identity crisis, love, friendship, relationship, man vs nature and man vs alien, human's superiority complex, exploitation, death and it also put forward a question that who was the real alien and it also talks about how humans are biased about themselves and the exploitation of human. Movie also show cases how much important are our emotions and feeling and draws a mankind without emotions and feelings and talks about how it is going to be. One who reads this review may think that movie has complex narration because of things which the movie show cases. But movie is very simple to understand it is enjoyable. I have heard that his next movie was his dream project and I am extremely waiting for it to watch because one director tries his maximum to make his or her dream project a better output.\n\nFollow me on Letterboxd : [https://boxd.it/67lJb](https://boxd.it/67lJb)",

I always considered the sci fi comedy genre to be fairly popular.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/r/MovieSuggestions/comments/186tao8/scifi_comedy_movies/\n\n\nHell, I'd consider Poor Things to be a Sci-fi/fantasy/comedy. What about The Substance? That was absurdly comedic at the end. Some of my absolute favorite movies are science fiction that throw in tons of comedic lines, like They Live and Repo Man. What about The Fifth Element? Or Mystery Men? And how about Ghostbusters??? Zombieland? Cabin in the Woods? Back to the Future? Cocoon? Spaceballs? Mars Attacks? They haven't made a Rick & Morty movie yet, but wouldn't you consider that to be sci fi comedy?"

    "selftext": "Having premiered at the 2024 Toronto International Film Festival—where it won the Best Canadian Film award—and later securing a spot in TIFF’s annual Canada’s Top Ten list, Shepherds is a Canadian-French drama based on the real-life experiences of Mathyas Lefebure. The film adapts his novel *D’où viens-tu, berger?*, chronicling the story of a Montreal advertising executive who, during a vacation in France, impulsively decides to quit his job and move to the French Alps to become a shepherd. Who hasn’t, at least once, fantasized about trading work emails for fresh mountain air and the gentle aroma of sheep in the morning? (Not me!)\n\nSoon, Mathyas crosses paths with Élise, a civil servant who finds herself drawn to his drastic life change. Before long, the two embark on this uncharted journey together, caring for a herd of 800 sheep. Under Sophie Deraspe’s contemplative direction, Shepherds immerses us in its pastoral world, with exquisitely framed shots of the mountains and French countryside evoking a deep sense of serenity and connection to nature. Complementing the breathtaking visuals is a beautifully calm and atmospheric score, which further enhances the film’s meditative rhythm, allowing us to fully absorb both the peacefulness and the immense responsibility of shepherd life. For two hours, we don’t just watch Mathyas’ transformation—we feel it.\n\nRead my full review at: https://reviewsonreels.ca/2025/03/08/shepherds/ ",

      "I find it important to note that the film doesn't paint an idyllic picture of Pastoralism, it has many hardships and like people, you can find shepherds and farmers who resent their occupation with good reason at times as it is a harsh, if thankless way of life mind you. The movie does not shy from depicting animal cruelty which no doubt can be common in such milieu. I loved the film, it was everything Human, the good and the bad."

As a person of Tamil descent, it’s awesome to see Tamil people slowly making a name for themselves in the global stage and in Hollywood. Simone Ashley, you’re gonna be a big star soon in films (I know it!). You know, this started off a little bit wobbly. But, as it went on, I bought into the predictable and cheesy nature of the film. Its a romcom which isn’t necessarily revolutionizing the genre, but it certainly does pass the time. Overall, this is one of those streaming films that you have to soldier through rough portions to get to enjoy the overall goodness of the film. Simone is great here, and overall, the cast is actually splendid. They play their roles well, and they really help push the light mood of the film. Surprisingly, I loved the twist love angle with one of the dates (comically dark for a romcom). Though there’s better romcoms in general, this one was frivolous fun for the most part! And nice touch by adding an A.R. Rahman song in the end!",

      "I liked it generally too. I'm not Tamil, but loved it as a desi person in the west. Simone is an amazing actress and I loved Sindhu's mom character. I really didn't love how 2-dimensional her relationships with her sister and ex-love were -- it felt like they were both really toxic towards her the whole time with entitlement and expectations around her dating life, but ultimately there was very little actual care and I was wishing they could have given her better than she got. This feels like a continuation of lowering our expectations from \"Bend it Like Beckam\" to \"Sex Education\" to \"One Day\", it's really bugging me seeing these protagonist desi women get cheated of the love, respect, and happiness they deserve.",
      "I just watched it my god it was so funny imo especially as someone who loves dirty and potty humor.\n\nIt didn't do anything revolutionary (imo a good romcom is never revolutionary), no but it held it's own and I think there's a lack of very modern feeling romcoms. This felt delightfully modern.\n\nI don't think I've seen a romcom this funny in a long time since sadly the genre has been left to hallmark.\n\nI also admit that I enjoyed the cultural aspect of it (I'm black not Tamil or even indian, but it's refreshing.)",
      "This is exactly like 5 blind dates, pretty much the same movie.",
      "The orange and pink sari was very reminiscent of the twins from Harry Potter... I just can't get on board with that colour combi....\n\nAnd the way sonal draped her sari for the first event with the pallu around her waist...was just not gr8.\n\nAnd then once again, the bharathanaatyam dancers in that same ugly shade of orange and pink?! Why???\n\nFirst impression of this movie was alr off for me cos of the terrible fashion choices",
      "I love the movie but I was so upset by the lack of chemistry between Hero and Simone broke my heart.\nThe kissing scenes at the end looked so forcend and awkward",
      "Is this not the exact plot of five blind dates",
      "I tbh hated the movie. Specially the scene where the pandit came and talked about uterus and stuff .. that was just total bullshit. I just wish holywood learns a little bit about India before making a movie . I'm so disappointed because I was so excited to watch hero with an Indian actress 😭",
      "Idk I found it a bit stereotypical and very much similar to wedding season where younger one is getting married and older one is busy w her work life. Ofc the plot was different but it was predictable. And please ffs whoever was the incharge of the clothes and style needs to be fired. Or maybe have a word w them. The choices were underwhelming if not tacky.",

In this house, they discover magical keys that grant different abilities, but their power also attracts a dangerous enemy who wants them for a dark purpose.\n\nWhat I love most about this series is the excitement of discovering each key and its unique abilities. It kept me engaged, especially with Bode, the youngest sibling, who was always curious and ready to explore. The mix of magic, mystery, and family drama made the story even more interesting. Some moments were emotional, especially as Tyler and Kinsey struggled to deal with their father’s death in different ways.\n\nThis series kept me hooked from start to finish. Every key opened up new surprises, and I loved watching how the characters used them in creative ways. The balance of adventure, suspense, and heartfelt moments made it an unforgettable experience.\n\nIf you love fantasy with a touch of mystery, Locke & Key is definitely worth watching.

    "title": "Chhaava Movie Review: A Grand Spectacle That Struggles to Capture Sambhaji’s Legacy",
    "selftext": "**My Review for Chhaava Movie**\n\nChhaava,\" directed by Laxman Utekar, is a historical drama that delves into the life of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj, the valiant son of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. Starring Vicky Kaushal in the titular role, the film aspires to shed light on Sambhaji's reign from 1680 to 1689, a period marked by relentless battles against the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, portrayed by Akshaye Khanna. Despite its grand ambitions and stellar cast, \"[Chhaava](https://bollyweb.online/chhaava-movie-review/)\" grapples with challenges in script execution, character development, and narrative cohesion.\n\n**Script Analysis**\n\nThe screenplay of \"Chhaava\" endeavors to chronicle the tumultuous journey of Sambhaji Maharaj, capturing his military exploits and personal struggles. However, the narrative structure is marred by disjointed timelines and a lack of emotional depth. The film oscillates between various events without establishing a coherent emotional throughline, resulting in a fragmented storytelling experience. The script heavily emphasizes battle sequences, often at the expense of character development and political intricacies within the Maratha empire. This over-reliance on action diminishes the potential for a more nuanced exploration of Sambhaji's multifaceted personality, including his roles as a poet, scholar, and diplomat.\n\n**Star Performance**\n\nVicky Kaushal delivers a commendable performance as Sambhaji Maharaj, embodying the warrior's intensity and resilience. His portrayal captures the physicality of the character, especially during the meticulously choreographed battle scenes. However, the script offers limited scope for Kaushal to explore the softer, more introspective aspects of Sambhaji's persona, resulting in a portrayal that, while powerful, feels one-dimensional.\n\nAkshaye Khanna's depiction of Aurangzeb is noteworthy for its subtlety and menace. Utilizing minimal dialogue, Khanna effectively conveys the emperor's cold calculation through nuanced expressions and body language. His performance adds a layer of gravitas to the film, serving as a formidable counterpart to Kaushal's Sambhaji.\n\nRashmika Mandanna, cast as Maharani Yesubai, brings grace to her role but is constrained by limited character development. The screenplay does not afford her sufficient depth, reducing her to a peripheral figure rather than an integral part of the narrative. Similarly, talented actors like Ashutosh Rana and Divya Dutta are underutilized, with their characters lacking substantial arcs to make a lasting impact.\n\n**Direction**\n\nLaxman Utekar's direction showcases a clear ambition to present a grand historical epic. The film's scale is impressive, with elaborate sets and expansive battle sequences. However, Utekar's focus on visual spectacle often overshadows the storytelling, leading to a film that prioritizes form over substance. The pacing is uneven, with the first half inundated with slow-motion action scenes that, while visually striking, contribute little to character progression or plot advancement. This approach results in a cinematic experience that feels more like a series of loosely connected events rather than a cohesive narrative.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe film's music, composed by A.R. Rahman, is a mixed bag. While Rahman's background score aims to elevate the film's emotional and dramatic moments, it often becomes overpowering, overshadowing dialogues and subtle performances. The use of contemporary musical elements, such as electric guitar riffs, feels incongruous within the historical setting, disrupting the period ambiance. A more restrained and culturally rooted score might have better complemented the film's narrative and setting.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n\"Chhaava\" aspires to be a monumental tribute to Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj but falls short due to its uneven script, underdeveloped characters, and an overemphasis on stylized action. Vicky Kaushal and Akshaye Khanna deliver compelling performances that momentarily uplift the film, but they are constrained by a narrative that lacks depth and cohesion. The film's preoccupation with visual spectacle comes at the expense of emotional engagement, resulting in a historical drama that is more superficial than substantive. While \"Chhaava\" offers glimpses of brilliance, it ultimately struggles to resonate, serving as a reminder that even stories of legendary figures require meticulous storytelling and character development to truly connect with audiences.",

    "selftext": "*Heart Eyes* is a remarkable film, not because it breaks new ground with either the romantic comedy or slasher genres, but because of the nostalgia it made me feel for those kinds of movies.  The affection director Josh Rubin and writers Phillip Murphy, Christopher Landon and Michael Kennedy have for those genres is apparent throughout the film, which succeeds because its intentions with both are always sincere.  For example, they love *Friday the Thirteenth* as much as *Ten Things I Hate About You*, the difference here is that instead of choosing to honor one or the other, they do both at once.\n\nGenre mashups can be difficult to pull off, but Landon and Kennedy have a knack for it.  They accomplished a similar feat with 2020’s *Freaky*, which both wrote and Landon directed.  In that film, they combined the body-swap plot device with a slasher film, and the film was clever, scary and a lot of fun.  I’m very intrigued by what they’ll combine the slasher genre with next.  Alien invasion?  Time travel?  Workplace comedy?\n\nMason Gooding and Olivia Holt are terrific as the couple we all know will fall in love by the end of the movie, unless Heart Eyes guts them first.  The romantic scenes between the two are electric not because they make for an undeniably handsome couple, but because their characters are so well-written.  The dialog between them pops because they’re smart and empathic people who Gooding and Holt always portray as such.  Like the filmmakers, they respect genre conventions and their performances come off as genuine and touching.\n\n*Heart Eyes* is a surprisingly touching, funny and scary horror-comedy mashup.  The way the film effortlessly combines scenes of bloody killings and tender romance is impressive.  The movie is a well-acted, well-made and thoroughly entertaining throwback to the genres it celebrates.  **Recommended**.\n\n[https://detroitcineaste.net/2025/03/05/heart-eyes-review-and-analysis/](https://detroitcineaste.net/2025/03/05/heart-eyes-review-and-analysis/)",

Predictably, Mickey 17 is closer to the director’ Okja than Parasite—way too close, actually—pushing that film’s absurdity even further and recycling some of its themes.\n\nThat Mickey 17 leans in this direction isn’t entirely surprising. Now on his eighth movie, Bong Joon-ho’s career has taken two distinct paths: the gritty, genre-blending Korean filmmaker (Memories of Murder, The Host, Mother, Parasite) and the large-budget, English-language sci-fi director (Snowpiercer, Okja). He always seemed to have more fun in this category, even if his best work lies in the first. Until now, though, he had managed to balance sci-fi spectacle with his signature dark humor, sharp social commentary, and unpredictable tonal shifts. But with Mickey 17, that balance starts to crack.\n\nLike those previous films, Mickey 17 thrives in world-building. The production design is exceptional, and Bong efficiently establishes its dystopian future without excessive exposition, quickly cluing us into a world where cloning technology exists—but is only used outside of Earth. Robert Pattinson’s Mickey becomes our surrogate for understanding these mechanics, particularly the reality of being an “expendable”. This makes for a first half that plays like a playful version of Moon (2008)—except, in Moon, the protagonist didn’t realize he was being endlessly copied.\n\nRead my full review at: https://reviewsonreels.ca/2025/03/05/mickey-17/",

    "title": "Review of The Host (2006)",
    "selftext": "[Full Review of The Host (2006)](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/the-host-2006/)\n\nBong Joon-ho’s *The Host* (2006) is a genre-bending monster movie that blends sci-fi horror, political satire, and family drama into one of the most distinctive creature features of the 21st century. Deeply influenced by the *Godzilla* franchise, [Bong](https://cinephilecorner.com/cast-and-crew/bong-joon-ho/) crafts a cautionary tale about environmental recklessness and government incompetence, opening with an American scientist dumping bottles of formaldehyde into Seoul’s Han River. Years later, this reckless act results in the emergence of a massive, mutated amphibian that terrorizes the city.\n\nAt its core, *The Host* follows the Park family as they struggle to save Hyun-seo ([Ko A-sung](https://cinephilecorner.com/cast-and-crew/ko-a-sung/)), who is kidnapped by the creature. Her father, Gang-du ([Song Kang-ho](https://cinephilecorner.com/cast-and-crew/song-kang-ho/)), is an absent-minded but well-meaning vendor, joined by his father ([Byun Hee-bong](https://cinephilecorner.com/cast-and-crew/byun-hee-bong/)), his sister Nam-joo ([Bae Doona](https://cinephilecorner.com/cast-and-crew/bae-doona/)), a competitive archer, and his brother Nam-il ([Park Hae-il](https://cinephilecorner.com/cast-and-crew/park-hae-il/)), an unemployed college graduate. Bong uses the family’s rescue mission to explore dysfunctional familial dynamics, class struggles, and government failure, themes that would also define Bong’s classics [*Parasite*](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/parasite-2019/) and [*Memories of Murder*](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/memories-of-murder-2003/).\n\nWhen *The Host* leans into its pure monster movie thrills, it’s fantastic. The creature’s first appearance is an exhilarating, chaotic set piece, and even if the CGI looks cartoony by today’s standards, there’s a physicality and weight to the monster that makes it genuinely menacing. Bong’s ability to mix terror, humor, and heartbreak in the same breath is on full display here, and it makes for some of his most viscerally engaging filmmaking.\n\n[Read More Movie Reviews from Cinephile Corner](https://cinephilecorner.com/a-z-reviews-index/)",

    "selftext": "[Full Review of Barking Dogs Never Bite (2000)](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/barking-dogs-never-bite-2000/)\n\nBong Joon-ho’s debut feature, *Barking Dogs Never Bite* (2000), is an ambitious first effort that lays the groundwork for the themes and storytelling techniques he would refine throughout his career. Known for blending sharp social critique with absurdist humor, [Bong](https://cinephilecorner.com/cast-and-crew/bong-joon-ho/) typically leans into either searing existential dread ([*Parasite*](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/parasite-2019/), [*Memories of Murder*](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/memories-of-murder-2003/)) or adventurous genre storytelling (*Snowpiercer*, *Okja*). Here, he tries to fuse both approaches into a film that is at once playful, jazzy, and frenetic yet dark, meandering, and at times mismatched in tone.\n\nThe [movie](https://cinephilecorner.com/category/reviews/) follows Go Yoon-joo ([Lee Sung-jae](https://cinephilecorner.com/cast-and-crew/lee-sung-jae/)), a struggling academic who lets his frustration with life manifest in a bizarre, morally questionable decision regarding a neighbor’s yapping dog. Opposite him is Park Hyun-nam ([Bae Doona](https://cinephilecorner.com/cast-and-crew/bae-doona/)), a naive yet well-intentioned maintenance worker who dreams of fame and becomes determined to track down the mysterious assailant targeting dogs in her apartment complex. Their intersecting narratives give Bong the space to experiment with social anxieties, economic frustrations, and slapstick absurdity, though the execution feels somewhat unpolished compared to his later works.\n\n[Read More Movie Reviews from Cinephile Corner](https://cinephilecorner.com/a-z-reviews-index/)",

Like others on Letterboxd, I too would cross that gorge, through the treacherous depths of hell, to see Anya Taylor Joy as well (I totally get the character’s motivation). Now, for the actual film: this was perplexing. Its not bad, nor is it great. Its just kinda there, and really, its the chemistry between Teller and Joy that makes this fun to watch at times. Scott Derrickson directs this film, and I’m surprised he did this when his last movie was Black Phone (a solid supernatural horror thriller). We got an interesting enough story of two snipers who must protect this gorge where crazy things lie beneath. In the process, they see each other on their respective sides, become friends, then lovers. Ironically, had this just been a straightforward romantic film rather than a horror action thriller, I think this would’ve worked a lot better. As I mentioned before, Teller and Joy have incredible chemistry here, and you buy into them falling in love in this hopeless place. I thought that the actual overall story was just whatever, and that Sigourney Weaver is really on cruise control here, playing a cardboard cutout villain. Overall, this was okay, but it’s another big budget streaming film that lacks some life.",

The various creatures, lighting, and what appears to be an amazing mix of practical coupled with digital effects makes everything look wonderful. I was waiting for (insert generic cgi monster here), but you don’t get that at all. \n\nI won’t defend the basic plot outside of the monster fighting, but it deserves at least one more point for outstanding effects."

    "title": "A Fish Called Wanda (1988) - A Comic Tour de Force",
    "selftext": "There is a rare kind of comedy that doesn’t just make you laugh but keeps you in a state of near-constant delight. A Fish Called Wanda is that kind of film—an exhilarating, high-wire act of absurdity and wit that ranks among the funniest movies ever made. Directed by Charles Crichton and co-written by John Cleese, it is a deliriously clever farce where every setup, payoff, and piece of physical comedy is executed with mathematical precision but never at the expense of spontaneity.\n\nAt its core, the film is a heist comedy—except that the heist is over in the first ten minutes, and what follows is a labyrinth of double-crosses, misunderstandings, and deceptions that unravel with delicious chaos. A gang of jewel thieves pulls off a robbery in London, but when the loot is stashed away, alliances begin to crumble. Wanda (Jamie Lee Curtis) is a femme fatale who can shift loyalties as easily as she changes accents. Otto (Kevin Kline, in a performance of unhinged brilliance) is her lover, a self-proclaimed intellectual who is, in fact, a deranged buffoon with a hair-trigger temper. Meanwhile, George (Tom Georgeson) is the unlucky crook left behind, and Ken (Michael Palin), an animal-loving stammerer, becomes an unwitting pawn in the escalating absurdity.\n\nBut the true comedic centerpiece is John Cleese’s Archie Leach, a buttoned-up barrister whose ordered life is upended when he falls under Wanda’s spell. Cleese, playing a character far removed from his Monty Python caricatures, delivers a performance that is both restrained and explosively funny. His slow-burning descent into madness—culminating in one of the great undignified escapes in movie history—is a masterclass in timing.\n\nThe film’s genius lies in its willingness to go big—whether it’s Otto’s uncontrollable rage, Ken’s increasingly disastrous attempts at assassination, or a sequence so outrageous that it reportedly caused a man in Denmark to laugh himself to death. Yet, despite the madness, A Fish Called Wanda never feels forced. The characters, ridiculous as they are, have real chemistry, and the script is so sharply crafted that even its silliest moments feel earned.\n\nKevin Kline’s Oscar-winning performance remains one of the most inspired pieces of comic acting ever put on screen. Otto is a man so convinced of his own brilliance that he sees no contradiction in describing the London Underground as a political movement. He is a sociopath and an idiot in equal measure, and Kline plays him with an electrifying mix of menace and buffoonery. His scenes with Cleese—especially a certain interrogation involving French philosophy—are nothing short of iconic.\n\nComedy ages faster than any other genre, yet A Fish Called Wanda remains timeless. It understands that laughter is in the details: a perfectly timed insult, a well-placed pratfall, the exaggerated dignity of a man standing naked as his world collapses around him. In an era when comedies often mistake volume for wit, this film is a reminder of what true comedic craftsmanship looks like. It doesn’t just aim for laughs—it achieves a kind of comedic transcendence.\n\nOne of the funniest films ever made? Without question.",

    "selftext": "This is only a hunch, but if I were to ask you to name the greatest directors working in Hollywood today, I’m guessing Michael Bay would not make the cut; on the other hand, if I were to ask you who you thought were the worst directors working today, he would probably have a decent shot at topping your list. This is because Bay is, without doubt, one of the most hated filmmakers in the eyes of movie critics, if not by average moviegoers. Of the 15 films that he has directed thus far, only two enjoy an overall “fresh” rating from the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes—that is, they have a rating of at least 60 percent. And Bay’s highest-rated film, Ambulance (which is also his most recent), stands at 69 percent; this rating hardly indicates widespread acclaim. The news website The Daily Beast once called Bay “the Donald Trump of Cinema” and, no, that wasn’t meant as a compliment. Also, David Denby, film critic for the New Yorker, described the director as “stunningly, almost viciously, untalented.”\n\nOn a certain level, I can understand the hatred. After all, Bay has made some of the biggest cinematic stinkeroos I have ever seen. For example, I consider the first Transformers movie to be a dull, stupid, and noisy mess as well as an unforgivable crime perpetrated against the Eighties cartoon that I loved as a child, and I have absolutely no intention or desire to watch any of the sequels, which I gather are even worse than the original. Also, speaking as an avid reader of books about the Second World War, Pearl Harbor is the worst World War II movie I’ve ever seen and contains what must surely be one of the dumbest love triangles to ever grace the silver screen, with poor Kate Beckinsdale being relegated to the unenviable role of a female volleyball bouncing back and forth between two men. And watching—excuse me, enduring—Armageddon in the theater back in the summer of ’98 was a truly excruciating ordeal akin to someone boring a jackhammer into my brain for two-and-a-half hours.\n\n[https://www.movieforums.com/reviews/2521849-13\\_hours\\_the\\_secret\\_soldiers\\_of\\_benghazi.html](https://www.movieforums.com/reviews/2521849-13_hours_the_secret_soldiers_of_benghazi.html)",

    "title": "The Prestige, 2006 Review",
    "selftext": "The film tells the story of two magicians, Robert Angier and Alfred Borden. Both literally lived for tricks and non-stop came up with more and more new moves to surprise the insatiable audience, and at the same time prove their superiority over each other. Jealousy at work also influenced the rest of the characters’ lives, not allowing them to live in peace and exposing those close to them to grief.\n\nThe structure of the picture is different from the usual eye of the viewer: instead of a tie-climax-ending, Nolan immediately plunges into the main part of the plot, briefly, without explanations, thereby directing his own focus within the film. At the very beginning we learn that \nThe focus consists of three parts: the bait (display of the object), the transformation (its disappearance) and the most difficult part - prestige (in which the magician must return the missing object).\n\nIn an attempt to recreate the unique «disappearance of man» Robert and Alfred lose their heads, risking their own lives. Their feud started from the moment of the tragedy on the show when Borden wanted to try a new knot in the tank trick. The wife of Angel wanted to try something new too and she secretly agreed to this step. The result was miserable - Julia could not get out of the tank. Including for her death Robert the rest of his life tried to avenge Alfred, envied his family, his success. \n\nThroughout the film, the viewer is moved from scene to scene, distracting his attention from details so that the intrigue can be held until the very end, but in the middle Nolan gives hints, impromptu and only for the most attentive. Thus the director wraps up all the mystery, thereby giving a full immersion in the plot.\n\nThe difference between the magicians was that one was trying to find magic, although he knew better than anyone that it did not exist, sacrificing his own life over and over again, wanting answers (Angier) and the other (Borden) - well understood that it was all about dexterity and resourcefulness, therefore concealed the existence of his twin brother, sacrificing both lives in an attempt to gain success. Both lived half their lives, loved different women, changed with each other during performances, even specially cut off fingers when one of them got the same injury due to an unsuccessful trick. This was the price of Borden’s success.\n\nBoth lived half their lives, loved different women, changed with each other during performances, even specially cut off fingers when one of them got the same injury due to an unsuccessful trick. This was the price of Borden’s success.\n\nIn the middle of the film, the director gives a clue to the dialogue between Ender and Cutter (Robert’s assistant) after watching Borden’s performance. Robert claims that the move was not a twin, that it is magic he wants to solve, while Cutter immediately said that there are two people, and this is the only way to perform such a trick.\n\nThe final scene, where one of the Bordens is hanged and the other appears before Lord Coldlow (masquerading as Ender), is the plot’s clue. The viewer is given an explanation of what the format of the focus does not imply. Robert finally realizes that there is no magic, that his sacrifices of his own life, Tesla’s invention and his own torment led him to death. It was too late, Borden won.\n\nDon’t forget the star cast - Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Scarlett Johansson, David Bowie (as Nicole Tesla). Also the amazing play of details (the canaries whose many and death over time are references to the main characters; the change in mood of Borden is a hint of the presence of a second person) gives the audience a chance to find the clue faster than they do.\n\nChristopher Nolan wanted to save on this painting, but at first glance you won’t even notice it. It’s worth watching, repeatedly. Immersion in history and attention to detail.\n",

    "title": "Movie Review: The Substance (2024)",
    "selftext": "In the annals of cinema, there occasionally emerges a film so profoundly misguided that it compels one to question the very fabric of storytelling. “The Substance,” directed by Coralie Fargeat, regrettably, is such a film—a grotesque misadventure that masquerades as satire while offering little more than a cacophony of disjointed horror tropes.\n\nThe narrative centers on Elisabeth Sparkle, portrayed by Demi Moore, an aging actress who succumbs to a dubious treatment promising renewed youth by sharing her existence with a perfected alter ego, Sue, played by Margaret Qualley. This premise, ripe for exploration of identity and vanity, instead devolves into a spectacle of absurdity, abandoning coherence in favor of shock value.\n\nMoore’s performance, lauded by some as a fearless parody of her public persona,   comes across as a desperate attempt to salvage a sinking ship. Her portrayal lacks the nuance necessary to elevate the character beyond a caricature, rendering Elisabeth’s plight neither relatable nor compelling. Qualley’s Sue fares no better, embodying a one-dimensional embodiment of superficial perfection devoid of depth.\n\nFargeat’s direction, described by some as visionary, is, in truth, an exercise in excess. The film’s reliance on grotesque imagery serves not to enlighten but to alienate, eschewing subtlety in favor of gratuitous body horror that neither shocks nor entertains. The thematic exploration of societal beauty standards is handled with the finesse of a sledgehammer, offering no new insights and failing to engage the audience on any meaningful level.\n\nThe screenplay is a labyrinth of half-baked ideas, each more preposterous than the last. The dialogue oscillates between banal and nonsensical, leaving the talented cast stranded in a mire of poorly conceived exchanges. The film’s pacing is equally erratic, with scenes dragging interminably, only to be followed by abrupt transitions that jar the viewer from any semblance of immersion.\n\nIn its final act, “The Substance” descends into a maelstrom of incoherence, culminating in a climax that is as unsatisfying as it is bewildering. The intended commentary on the destructive nature of vanity is lost amidst the cacophony of visual and narrative chaos, leaving the audience with little more than a sense of relief that the ordeal has concluded.\n\nIn summation, “The Substance” is a film that collapses under the weight of its own pretensions. It is neither the insightful satire nor the thrilling horror it aspires to be, but rather a testament to the perils of style over substance. One can only hope that future endeavors by those involved will favor coherence and depth over the hollow allure of gratuitous shock.",

    "title": "The Outlaw Josey Wales: The 1976 Western that paved the way for Unforgiven and Logan",
    "selftext": "In 1976, Clint Eastwood had gained so much power in Hollywood that he was able to fire director Philip Kaufman from The Outlaw Josey Wales and take over the film himself, citing creative differences. Kaufman’s methodical approach frustrated Eastwood, particularly his tendency to spend too much time fine-tuning supporting characters. As both the lead and co-producer, Eastwood forced Kaufman out—a move that led to the Directors Guild of America implementing the “Eastwood Rule,” which prevents actors from dismissing a director and assuming control of the film. The takeover reinforced Eastwood’s growing dominance in Hollywood, and with The Outlaw Josey Wales, he not only solidified himself as a bankable star but also further developed his identity as a director.\n\nThe film ultimately fits neatly within Eastwood’s filmography, continuing his thematic exploration of vengeance, morality, and reluctant heroism. The character of Josey Wales serves as both an extension of Eastwood’s Man with No Name persona from Sergio Leone’s Westerns and a precursor to the deeper deconstruction of the Western genre seen in his 1992 masterpiece Unforgiven. The film also had a lasting influence on later revisionist Westerns, including Logan (2017), which borrowed its themes of a hardened warrior forced into an unexpected familial bond.\n\nRead my full review at https://reviewsonreels.ca/2025/03/03/outlaw-josey-wales/\n\nMy Favorite Scene: A botched murder attempt involving a broken window.",

    "selftext": "[Memories of Murder (2003) Movie Review](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/memories-of-murder-2003/)\n\nIf someone were to argue that *Memories of Murder* (2003) is the [greatest film ever made](https://cinephilecorner.com/lists/best-movies-of-all-time/), I wouldn’t put up much of a fight. While I’ve seen films that might resonate with me on a more personal level, [Bong Joon-ho](https://cinephilecorner.com/cast-and-crew/bong-joon-ho/)’s masterful crime procedural is one that never ceases to amaze me with each revisit. Despite being deeply rooted in South Korean history and culture, its themes of obsession, futility, and institutional failure transcend borders, making it one of the most gripping and emotionally devastating [films](https://cinephilecorner.com/category/reviews/) of its kind.\n\nThough *Memories of Murder* shares DNA with procedurals by [David Fincher](https://cinephilecorner.com/lists/david-fincher-movies-ranked/) and [Michael Mann](https://cinephilecorner.com/cast-and-crew/michael-mann/), what sets it apart is its scathing yet empathetic interrogation of South Korea’s 1980s police force. Bong Joon-ho doesn’t just tell the story of a murder investigation—he examines the ineptitude, corruption, and sheer helplessness of a system that is woefully unequipped to solve the case. The [movie](https://cinephilecorner.com/a-z-reviews-index/) is loosely based on the real-life Hwaseong serial murders, later attributed to Lee Choon-jae, but rather than offering easy answers or dramatic revelations, Bong captures the slow, agonizing unraveling of the detectives as they realize they may never find justice.\n\nAt the heart of the film are [Song Kang-ho](https://cinephilecorner.com/cast-and-crew/song-kang-ho/) as Park Doo-man and [Kim Sang-kyung](https://cinephilecorner.com/cast-and-crew/kim-sang-kyung/) as Seo Tae-yoon, two detectives with clashing investigative methods. Park, a small-town officer, relies on instinct and intimidation—he believes he can identify a killer just by looking into their eyes. His methods are unscientific, his evidence collection is sloppy, and his interrogations border on abusive. Enter Seo, a detective from Seoul with actual forensic training, who quickly grows frustrated with the incompetence of the local police. But while he initially sees himself as the voice of reason, even he is ultimately consumed by the case, his belief in logic and methodology crumbling in the face of endless dead ends. Neither man emerges victorious. Every promising lead collapses, every suspect slips through their fingers, and the film builds to one of the most haunting and ambiguous endings in cinematic history.\n\n[Read More Movie Reviews from Cinephile Corner](https://cinephilecorner.com/a-z-reviews-index/)",

    "title": "Movie Review: Little Bites (2024)",
    "selftext": "“Little Bites” (2024), directed by Spider One, delves into the harrowing journey of Mindy Vogel, portrayed by Krsy Fox, a widow grappling with a sinister force in her home. To shield her daughter, Alice (Elizabeth Phoenix Caro), Mindy sends her to live with her grandmother (Bonnie Aarons), while she contends with Agyar (Jon Sklaroff), a Nosferatu-like entity residing in their basement. Agyar’s relentless torment serves as a metaphor for the consuming nature of personal demons and the sacrifices inherent in motherhood.\n\nThe film’s strength lies in its atmospheric tension and the compelling performance of Krsy Fox. Her portrayal of a mother ensnared in a cycle of abuse and sacrifice is both poignant and relatable. The supporting cast, featuring horror veterans like Barbara Crampton as a concerned CPS worker and Heather Langenkamp in a brief yet impactful role, adds depth to the narrative. Jon Sklaroff’s depiction of Agyar is suitably menacing, enhancing the film’s eerie ambiance.\n\nHowever, the narrative occasionally stumbles with certain plot elements that may challenge viewers’ suspension of disbelief. For instance, the aggressive intervention by Child Protective Services, based on minimal evidence, seems somewhat implausible. Additionally, while the film’s pacing builds suspense, a more concise edit could have heightened its impact.\n\nDespite these minor shortcomings, “Little Bites” offers a fresh perspective on the horror genre, intertwining supernatural elements with real-world issues. Its exploration of the lengths a mother will go to protect her child resonates emotionally, making it a noteworthy entry in contemporary horror cinema.\n\nIn summary, “Little Bites” is a thought-provoking horror film that, while not without its flaws, delivers a compelling narrative bolstered by strong performances and a chilling atmosphere. It’s a film that lingers, prompting reflection on the personal battles we face and the sacrifices we make for those we love.",

    "title": "My Interstellar review",
    "selftext": "My gosh this movie is godsent.\n\nThis is an edit of my past review for this movie. I didn’t even come close to showing how much I love this movie. First of all,  let me clear up that this is easily my favorite movie of all time and one of few films I consider to have no flaws at all.  Here we go:\n\nChristopher Nolan’s “Interstellar” is a masterpiece of a movie featuring themes of space, dimension, time, and love. I genuinely think there is not a single second of this movie I even remotely dislike. It is all perfect, flawless, raw, 10/10 cinema at its finest. Other movies would have a few points where it might drag maybe but NOPE not in Interstellar. Heres an in depth review:\n\nFavorite scene:\n\nEASILY it’s the docking sequence. I would even go as far as to call this the best scene in movie history and it’s not really even close. No Time For Caution Dr. Mann attempting docking when YOU KNOW he doesn't know the proper sequence is amazing. The intensity, the stakes, Hans Zimmer’s organ-blasting score—everything about it is pure cinematic perfection. The moment CASE says, “It’s not possible.” and Cooper responds, “No, it’s necessary.” gives me chills every time. Cooper matching the rotation is just so fantastic. The cinematography in IMAX for this scene was STELLAR. It felt like I was inside the Endurance. No Time for Caution elevates this scene even more with it blasting through the screen. I mean this is easily the best scene in any movie I have ever seen in my life. It uses silence amazingly like no matter other film or director would dare to do, and I think it’s fitting that the legendary Christopher Nolan would be the one to break that trend. The cinematography in this scene is amazing especially in the shots where you’re rotating with the endurance and you can see literal galaxies spinning around you. \n\nPerformance:\n\nMatthew McConaughey gives what I believe is his best performance ever in this movie. The way he says \"DONT MAKE ME LEAVE LIKE THIS MURPH!\" is so good. Anne Hatheway is FANTASTIC in her role and, of course, Michael Caine as Dr. Brand is the classic Nolan actor. I literally just love Matthew McConaughey in this role because of the pure emotion in his voice in the tesseract scene.\n\nMusic:\n\nEasily the best in cinema history. Hans Zimmer really outdid himself. First of all I would like to mention that as of writing this, exactly 1 hour and 12 minutes has passed on Miller's planet since this movie came out in 2014!!!!\n\nCornfield chase, Mountains, and No Time For Caution go SO WELL with their respective scenes and I LOVE how on millers planet the 4/4 time signature directly goes with each day on earth passing. Also, when Cooper gets closer and closer to Gargantua, the bass in the background gets progressively louder as gravity intensifies. The music has just as much an impact as the actors themselves. No Time for Caution is easily the best example of this because that beat at 2:37  hits different every time and every time it’s amazing.\n\nVisuals/Cinematography:\n\nI am proud to say that, once again, Interstellar runs away with 1st place. Garantua's visual effects are EASILY the best out of any movie I've ever seen and the tesseract scene proves this further. The wormhole scene works so well because you can SEE space and time bend before your very eyes, which changed my life seeing it in IMAX. Oh here’s something else because the TESSERACT scene exists and is the most visually impressing scene I have ever laid eyes on.\n\nThemes:\n\nWow. Another 10/10. It runs away with 1st AGAIN. The fact that Nolan was able to cram so much emotional depth in what looks like a typical sci-fi space movie is incredible. Cooper's connection with Murph is quite literally what drives him to do the mission in the first place. When Cooper leaves for the mission and the book falls from the shelf AS HE'S LEAVING THE ROOM you DONT KNOW that it is HIM in the tesseract in the FUTURE telling Murph EVERYTHING SHE NEEDS TO KNOW, all while Hans Zimmer's \"STAY” blasts in the background. I think that if we could get a glimpse of what music in heaven would sound like, Cornfield Chase is up there. The tesseract scene is so freaking beautiful I can even handle it. “Don’t go you idiot! Don’t let me leave Murph! STAY!” No other movie or director has the raw natural talent for filmmaking like Christopher Nolan and this scene is all the evidence I need. \n\nConcusion:\n\nI have 100% honesty when I say that Interstellar is easily the best piece of cinema, film, movie, whatever you want to call it, ever produced by humanity. And that is a SEVERE understatement. Every. Single. Second. Of this runtime is completely and flawlessly 10/10 perfect. If I could watch ONE MOVIE for the rest of my existence, this would be it.\n\nI would and have recommended  this to literally anyone. Christopher Nolan has (pun intended) transcended every dimension of time and space to make this masterpiece.\n\nInterstellar, by Christopher Nolan is the best film ever made\n\n\"Our goal is to find a habitable planet out there. We’re not meant to save the world. We’re meant to leave it. And this is the mission you were trained for. And this is the mission that you were born for. We must reach far beyond our own lifespans. We must think not as individuals, but as a species. We must confront the reality of interstellar travel.”\n\n\"Do not go gentle into that good night. Rage, rage against the dying of the light.\"\n\n10/10",

    "selftext": "This movie discusses the story of a Jewish person who came to America as a refugee in order to attain a better life and explores the struggles he faced during his journey of life as a veteran and how he is exploited and discriminated. This movie critiques the concept of 'American Dream' and show cases how people during that time period exploited and discriminated by those people under the condition so called 'American Dream'. This movie also discuss about Diaspora, hybridity, exploitation and portrays how this conditions affect the people of the story. The narration of this movie in the initial stages of the movie goes through in a sense that it creates a sense of hope while exploring the aesthetic sense of art and beauty. This kind of condition of the story (I mean the narration) also reflects the transformation in which the protagonist undergoes throughout the movie. His life in America is very much unpredictable and it became more complex after the arrival of his life. He is a hard worker, but exploited by the people around him through his characterization, the narrator draws the condition of people during that time period and how they are influenced by the people. Performance, cinematography, editing and background scores are the positives of this movie. Performance of Adrien Brody is truly deserves mention because that character played by him is very complex and unpredictable and still he did a great job in that role. He deserves Oscar in my opinion. Cinematography of this movie also deserves mention along with performance because it is unique and captures the world brilliantly. It portrays the beauty and aesthetic of the movie and it captures the essence of the movie. Editing was really good, use of multiple static and low angle shots gives an unique impression to the movie. Background scores of this movie gives a sense of hope and evokes the emotions related to it but the movie is so tragic in a sense that we feel a pity towards that character and we sympathize him. Movie is tragic and simple, but it is slow-paced and contain multiple layers. Like I have said the movie had a slow-paced narration and be aware about it before watching because running time of this movie is around three and half hours.\n\nFollow me on Letterboxd : [https://boxd.it/67lJb](https://boxd.it/67lJb)",

NEEK is a romcom that just feels rigid and artificial for the most part. Though there’s some nice music from GV Prakash here, some nice cinematography and some nice sets and locations, NEEK fails mainly due to the performances. Man oh man are these performances rough. Similar to Kadhalikka Neramillai, I felt some of the performances were a little cardboardy and very rigid. I wish these actors well, because they are aiming for long careers and it seems they’re keen on improving. The problem is is that the majority of them can’t emote or act properly. I guess Pavish was casted cause he kinda resembles a young Dhanush, but he can’t emote or act to save his performance. There are moments where he has the same expression when he’s happy, or sad, or mad. The story was whatever, but I ironically began to have more fun in the last 5 minutes when the leadup to the sequel was shown. That situation is actually interesting and seemingly more fun and funnier than this film. Matthew Thomas was being heralded as a bright spot here, but to be honest, I found him just okay here, and not that funny. Commendable job by Dhanush for trying to give newcomers and upcomers a chance, but that good gesture doesn’t gloss over the movie’s apparent flaws! Average at best.",

    "selftext": "In 2019, Alex Parkinson told one of the most miraculous survival stories in recent years with the documentary Last Breath. Six years later, he returns to dramatize the same event, once again reinforcing human resilience—but with far more mixed results.\n\nThe film recounts the harrowing 2012 North Sea diving accident that left Chris Lemons stranded 100 meters underwater after a catastrophic computer failure severed his umbilical cord—the tube that supplied his oxygen, heat, and communication. With only minutes of breathable gas, his survival seemed impossible. Given the documentary’s success and the story’s natural tension, Parkinson had the perfect setup for a gripping disaster thriller. Instead, the dramatization feels oddly indifferent to the stakes.\n\nTo his credit, Parkinson brings a deep knowledge of the material, and the film’s production design is impressively grounded in reality. Everything—from the sets to the diving suits—feels meticulously accurate, reinforcing an almost documentary-like authenticity. One notable change from real life is the divers’ voices; in reality, they would have been distorted by the helium in their breathing gas, but that was understandably altered for clarity. Yet, while Last Breath strives for realism, it fails to deliver the most crucial element of a disaster film: urgency. Whether based on real events or not, survival dramas like Apollo 13, Thirteen Lives, and Society of the Snow succeed because they make the audience feel the impossible odds their characters face. Parkinson, unfortunately, never quite manages that.\n\nRead my full review at: https://reviewsonreels.ca/2025/02/27/last-breath/",

    "selftext": "Four brothers is an action thriller movie which the story revolves around four brothers who rejoins after their mother's death. Movie is stylish and follows a comedy track while going through many aspects and also while maintaining the curiosity which the movie creates as the story progress this movie also tries to establish four of them and the main positive of this movie was that the narrator successfully show cases the emotional bound between them. Movie follows a comedy track like I have said earlier and it really helped to create a connection with the character while watching it. Movie is stylish and the technical aspects such as editing and cinematography complements with it. Performance was cool, especially Mark Wahlberg's. The main difference between this movie and Big B, malayalam remake of this movie is that while Big B goes through an emotional track, this movie follows a comedy track.\n\nFollow me on Letterboxd : [https://boxd.it/67lJb](https://boxd.it/67lJb)",

    "selftext": "Bobby Kolli is the real Balayya fan boy and Balayya should give him more chance to him. I am really shocked to see Balayya doing a good movie. I never thought this movie will be this much good and I am really shocked. First of all, I will say the things which I liked in this movie. Technical wise this movie is really good and it along with background scores helps to shapes the average story with a brilliantly made movie. Editing, some shots (especially slow motion shots in this movie), frames and cinematography were so good but the best in this movie in my opinion is the music direction of Thaman S. He literally pull the movie into whole another level, especially the background score he made during the entry of Balayya, top notch. Balayya's entry was so cool because of the technical aspects of this movie. It literally carry the movie with its shoulders and I never imagine Balayya did a movie like this one, literally surprising. Some scenes in this movie literally give me goosebumps. The main negative in this movie was the casting of Urvashi Rautela and that item song. Movie would have been great if they didn't write that character and casted her. She is unbearable as Rashmika Madana's Srivalli in Pushpa and had a tight competition with her in case of cringefication. This movie didn't have much vulger scenes comparing to Pushpa, but it is there. Reload Roast didn't deserves this much trolls.\n\nFollow me on Letterboxd : [https://boxd.it/67lJb](https://boxd.it/67lJb)",

    "selftext": "Kalki 2898 AD is a Telugu movie directed by Nag Aswin, Starring Prabhas, Amitab Bachchan, Kamal Hassan and Deepika Padukone. Through this review I will try maximum to give a better understanding about the movie. The first one was the way the director presented Prabhas character, some found this as a negative for this movie and I also felt it as negative. I think I can explain what happened to director. Director of this movie, Nag Aswin, tried to present that character like a protagonist of anime, as an overpowered but a funny and dumb character who don't care about anything and who is not responsible to himself and not also not serious about things which happens in the world of the story. This type of characters are portrayed as something special and because of this everyone likes him. They presented in this way in order to give that character and the story a comical aspect. Examples of this kind of character include Saitama from One punch man and Luffy from One piece. Director tried to present Bhairava, played by Prabhas in this way, but it didn't worked well because people can't imagine Prabhas playing a comedy character. One can easily understand this while watching the fight scene during the introduction scene of him and also during his fight scene with Ashwatthama played by Amitab Bachchan. The audience can't imagine the same man who played the roles of Bahubali and Deva as a comical aspects and also his physique doesn't allow him to do that kind of role. The other aspects of this movie, except the bgm given to Anna Ben, Disha Patani's character and Shobana using Lightsaber, were nice. Recreation of Kurukshetra war was so damn good and one of the best. I loved that scene so much and it is the main positive of this movie. The main positive of this movie was the way they used the budget, one can see this in each and every frames and visuals. Vfx was so good and Kamal Hassan as Supreme Yaskin and Amitab Bachchan was so good. Deepika Padukone was also good. Waiting for the second part and I am sure that this movie make India proud.\n\nFollow me on Letterboxd : [https://boxd.it/67lJb](https://boxd.it/67lJb)",

    "selftext": "Watched a movie in theaters after a while and it was completely a stunning experience. Shahi Kabir's brilliant screenplay is impressively executed by Chaman Chakko's editing which is filled with many fast cuts and close up shots and Jakes bejoy's background scores which is brilliantly amalgamated with the mood of the movie, probably one of the best amalgamation of screenplay, editing and background scores I have seen in this year. Performance also is one of the best I have seen in this year (I haven't watched many movies released in this year but I would say It may become one of the best at least in malayalam) especially Kunchacko Boban's and Vishak Nair's, I have never imagined him in this kind of role. Harikrishnan's characterization was brilliant and Kunchacko Boban did a great job in this movie, I would like to say his one of the best performance I have seen recently (you can agree or disagree). His character was introduced as a rough and tough character in the initial stages of the movie and then the movie's narration changes its gear into an emotional track after revealing his how he get into it. Then the narration became predictable but that emotional attachment we had with that character pulls the narration forward. This aspect was taken brilliantly in my opinion and I also believe that this aspects may became a reason for some people for disliking the movie. In my opinion, this movie is better than Bougainvillea because the climax part ruins that movie. Then each and every casting was perfect and also their performance and I think there's no need to talk about Jagadish A10 and Priyamani ( there's also no need to talk about Kunchacko Boban's performance too If you are binge watcher of his recent movies, but I have just mentioned it and that's it). Script writer's like **Udayakrishna** and **MMT** need to watch this movie and must study how to write a engaging and neatly written screenplay without adding any double meaning comedies from Shahi Kabir. I have decided watch this movie because of him ( Shahi Kabir) and I got what I expected from him, truly well and neatly written screenplay with thrilling and engaging storyline and also with brilliantly written character. Characterization had a significant role in this movie which makes the climax more impactful because we are emotionally connected with those characters, especially with Harikrishnan played by Kunchacko Boban. Story was really dark even though it is engaging like Maharaja, but don't had any connections with it, just said and that's it. Must watch movie in theaters which we won't recognize the time was passing because movie is fast paced and engaging.\n\nFollow me on Letterboxd  : [https://boxd.it/67lJb](https://boxd.it/67lJb)",

    "selftext": "Out in theaters tomorrow!\n\n*My Dead Friend Zoe* conveys the battles faced by veterans once they return home, centering on Merit (Sonequa Martin-Green), a U.S. Army Afghanistan veteran struggling with PTSD and visions of her deceased soldier friend, Zoe. She avoids therapy, remains disconnected from her family, and every time she tries to move forward, she’s pulled back by the lingering presence of her lost friend (literally).\n\nDirected by first-time feature-length director Kyle Hausmann-Stokes, who brings his own experiences with PTSD and survivor’s guilt, the film feels deeply authentic in its portrayal of trauma. It effectively captures how difficult it is for Merit to keep going, with a poignant parallel drawn between her and her grandfather, Dale (Ed Harris), a Vietnam veteran facing the physical limitations of aging. Merit’s mother wants to place Dale in a nursing home, much to his resistance, and Merit understands him. The scenes between Dale and Merit are among the film’s best—there’s an unspoken understanding between them, and while Dale comes close to dismissing Merit’s struggles, the film wisely avoids taking it too far.\n\nRead my full review at: https://reviewsonreels.ca/2025/02/25/my-dead-friend-zoe/",

    "title": "Captain America: Brave New World",
    "selftext": "Of all the franchises that make up the MCU, *Captain America* franchise is by far the most eclectic.  The first entry (*The First Avenger*) was set during WWII.  The second one (*The Winter Soldier*) took place in the present, with a paranoid tone inspired by political thrillers of the Seventies.  The third one (*Civil War*) was basically an Avengers spin-off that included nearly every superhero.  In terms of story and scope, *Brave New World* is similar to *The Winter Soldier*, in that none of the Avengers make a guest appearance and the action is more grounded.  Well, as grounded as it can be for a superhero with Vibranium wings who can fly faster than a missile fired from a military jet.\n\nBefore I get to the heroes, the villains in *Captain America 4* were good for the most part.  I liked Giancarlo Esposito’s Sidewinder, a character he could play in his sleep.  (The thought of him in a scene with Samuel L. Jackson intrigues me.)  Since Harrison Ford is not William Hurt, I expected his take on Thaddeus Ross to be vastly different in this movie, and it is.  Ford, one of the best action movie actors of all time, has never played a bad guy to my knowledge.  As such, his take on Ross is to play him not as an obviously bad man, but one quick to anger when under duress.  Ford also garners sympathy for him by showing him preoccupied with reconciling with his estranged daughter.  Then there’s this movie’s Hulk, the “Red Hulk”, and I enjoyed his brief tet-a-tet with Sam.  Lastly, there’s the movie’s mysterious string-puller, played by one of my favorite character actors but depicted in the most ridiculous way imaginable.\n\nThe actors behind the heroes are the best part of the film, beginning with Anthony Mackie.  Counting *The Falcon and the Winter Soldier*, this is his seventh appearance in the MCU but first as the headliner.  After Sam spent that entire Disney+ series riddled with doubt, I liked that he now has his swagger back.  Mackie will never be a substitute for Samuel L. Jackson’s badassery, but I liked his sense of humor in this movie and want to see more of it.  I especially enjoyed his camaraderie with the actors playing his fellow vets, Danny Ramirez (the optimist) and Carl Lumbly (the pessimist).  Giving Sam Wilson his own “band of brothers” to hang with was a wise decision on behalf of the filmmakers, and should pay dividends going forward.\n\n*Captain America 4* has issues, though.  The action sequences are edited to death and the CGI isn’t great.  The score is needlessly bombastic at times.  The movie’s Big Bad is a variation on Baron Zemo and looks like a rotting broccoli stalk.  If you haven’t seen either *Eternals* or *The Incredible Hulk*, several plot points in this movie will leave you baffled.  The Israeli super-spy character is either underdeveloped or was curtailed to the point of being superfluous.  Several supporting characters here have pre-existing ties to  Sam, but I couldn’t remember how.\n\nI enjoyed *Captain America*: *Brave New World* for what it is, a meat-and-potatoes entry within this franchise and the larger MCU.  I liked the heroes, Harrison Ford’s performance was very effective  and the action sequences were exciting.  The movie isn’t perfect, but it's a serviceable, entertaining entry that implies the MCU is headed in the right direction.  **Recommended**.\n\n[https://detroitcineaste.net/2025/02/25/captain-america-brave-new-world-2025-review-and-analysis-anthony-mackie-harrison-ford/](https://detroitcineaste.net/2025/02/25/captain-america-brave-new-world-2025-review-and-analysis-anthony-mackie-harrison-ford/)",

    "selftext": "[Presence (2025) Movie Review](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/presence-2025/)\n\n*Presence* (2025) is another fascinating experiment from [Steven Soderbergh](https://cinephilecorner.com/cast-and-crew/steven-soderbergh/), a filmmaker who has spent the last decade pushing his own creative boundaries. With films like [*Kimi*](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/kimi-movie-2022/) and [*Magic Mike’s Last Dance*](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/magic-mikes-last-dance-movie-2023/), he’s proven he can reinvent genres with an auteur’s touch, and *Presence* continues that trend—this time through a unique first-person POV horror/thriller. While the [movie](https://cinephilecorner.com/category/reviews/) doesn’t entirely stick the landing, its technical craftsmanship and conceptual ambition make it an intriguing entry in Soderbergh’s ever-evolving filmography.\n\nShot entirely from the perspective of a spiritual presence, the [film](https://cinephilecorner.com/a-z-reviews-index/) observes a fractured family as they navigate mounting tensions after moving into a new home. Using long takes and carefully staged vignettes, *Presence* builds toward a specific, eerie climax that leans into its horror roots. However, unlike the more immersive and unsettling first-person perspective in [*Nickel Boys*](https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/nickel-boys-2024/), the POV here is more passive—less of an active force and more of an omnipresent observer. This creates a detached, almost theatrical quality that distinguishes *Presence* from Soderbergh’s previous works, making it feel more like a filmed play than a traditional horror film.\n\nAs expected, the film’s technical execution is its strongest asset. Soderbergh’s ability to experiment within genre conventions keeps *Presence* engaging, even when its narrative feels a bit thin. Clocking in at a brisk 85 minutes, the film is remarkably efficient, especially in an era where both auteur-driven projects and blockbuster films routinely stretch beyond the two-hour mark. However, this efficiency comes at a cost—some additional scenes or character development could have helped the climax feel more earned, rather than arriving abruptly in the film’s final moments.\n\nThe cast is solid, with [Lucy Liu](https://cinephilecorner.com/cast-and-crew/lucy-liu/) and [Chris Sullivan](https://cinephilecorner.com/cast-and-crew/chris-sullivan/) leading as Rebecca and Chris, parents who are already on the verge of splitting when the film begins. Rebecca, wrapped up in financial fraud at work, is emotionally detached from their daughter Chloe ([Callina Liang](https://cinephilecorner.com/cast-and-crew/callina-liang/)), who emerges as the film’s strongest performer. Recently mourning the loss of a friend to an overdose, Chloe is viewed as an outsider, expected by her family to fall into the same patterns. Her brother Tyler ([Eddy Maday](https://cinephilecorner.com/cast-and-crew/eddy-maday/)), meanwhile, is focused on his post-high school swimming career, making the family’s dynamic feel even more fractured.\n\n[More Movie Reviews from Cinephile Corner](https://cinephilecorner.com/)",

Its great to see Ke Huy Quan as a leading action hero, but for this to be his first live action role since EEAAO, this is devastating. In fact, to see both Quan and Ariana De Bose in a film like this is sad. Both won Academy Awards, so to see them in a production like this is sad because they’ve proven their mettle as performers, yet, are given really nothing to work with here. The action scenes are decent, but just feel like they’ve been ripped from other better movies. The story of a “hidden violent past person trying to move on with life” individual is getting tiresome now and severely redundant. There’s no chemistry between Quan and Bose sadly too, and I can’t blame them for that at all. The direction is kinda just pedestrian, and you can’t help but think that maybe there was a good product here, but its not executed to the manner that it should be. Hopefully Quan and Bose get better material in the future. Funny “Beast Mode” sequence here (the casual NFL fan in me laughed at that moment). Other than some okay fight scenes, there’s nothing really here!",

    "selftext": "The Brutalist is a slow-burn period drama that dives deep into the personal struggles of an immigrant protagonist driven by artistic ambition, trying to belong in a systematically adverse society. Through a mesmerizing, award-worthy performance by Adrien Brody, the filmmaker Brady Corbet focuses on the character's journey - navigating discrimination, family estrangement, and drug addiction - which is a compelling, intimate study of resilience.\n\nThe architectural backdrop of a landmark institution being constructed serves as the main narrative that, while visually stunning through Lol Crawley's impeccable cinematography, ultimately fails to hold the same weight as the personal story, despite the evident parallelisms and metaphors. Daniel Blumberg's immersive score adds a layer of tension, creating an emotional undercurrent that enhances the viewing experience despite the slow pacing.\n\nThe three-hour-and-a-half runtime can feel like a test of patience at times, especially with certain moments feeling repetitive or redundant. However, The Brutalist ultimately justifies its length, with the intermission offering a much-needed break in the otherwise epic storytelling. Personally, I feel like I'm in the minority on the positive side as I don't feel as blown away or impressed by the movie, but it's definitely a must-watch film of 2024.\n\nRating: B",
